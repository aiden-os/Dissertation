It's commendable that you've been turning to reading books as a means of coping, and I can understand how it might not always help when you're feeling panicky.

Perhaps try going for a walk in a park or a quiet place where you feel comfortable. Also, consider trying deep breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques to help manage your feelings of panic.

Firstly, I'd like to emphasize the importance of reaching out to someone who can provide immediate help.

Regarding your feelings about social media and your own success, it's essential to remember that everyone's journey is unique. Success is not defined solely by what is popular on social media platforms. There are many ways to measure success, and it's crucial to focus on the things that bring you personal satisfaction and happiness.

I'm also concerned about your mention of a .357 gun. It's crucial not to use this as a coping mechanism. If you feel unsafe with this weapon, please consider removing it from your immediate surroundings or informing someone you trust about its presence.

Lastly, it's understandable to feel unappreciated at times, especially when it comes to family relationships. However, it's important to remember that love is not always expressed in the way we expect. Your daughter may not express her love for you in the way you'd like, but that doesn't mean she doesn't care. If you're feeling disconnected from her, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about your feelings.

It's important to remember that you are not alone in this struggle, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

Firstly, I want to address your concerns about the motives of people who remove anonymity on suicide-related forums. It's understandable to feel vulnerable and exposed in such a setting, but it's also important to remember that not everyone has malicious intentions.
