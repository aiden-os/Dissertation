"over time you begin to speak so fluently that you dont have to train yourself to think in the language, you just automatically do.",1
the same goes for being happy.,1
"over time, it will come naturally.",1

"im here for you as well, and im more than willing to listen to you.",1

"although depression is not something that you can simply tell yourself to get over, you do have responsibilities outside of it.",1
"maybe spending time with your son will even help cheer you up, i dont know, but you cant forget about him.",1
the reason i have faith in our species ability to spread and survive is that homo sapiens have surpassed themselves over and over again throughout their existence.,1
"the species does not stop toiling in its growth for my grand hopes or your bleak existential questioning, rather it utilizes these ideas to bolster its rapid acceleration of ability and the scope of its influence.",1
"i believe humanity  will do things unimaginable by the likes of you or me, as it has a billion times previous.",1
"look at the world around you, we have practically covered the surface of our planet with an asphalt mesh of roads.",1
"i consider theres a chance that our species will ultimately be wiped out, just as i consider theres a chance that when i compete i will be destroyed by those better than me, that when i leave my house i will get mowed down by a careless vehicle etc.",1
"however this does not stop me from striving to achieve my goals anyway, and i want you to know that ignorance regarding the point of our existence is no excuse for not continuing said existence.",1
"we may not matter to the universe, but as far as i can tell nothing does, the only being that cares about my existence is other humans around me.",1
"i wont exist in 100 years ill bet, but that doesnt mean that there is no meaning to the lifetime i find myself occupying now.",1
"i want to ask you, have you ever tried living for another person?",1
have you recently sought to gain happiness by providing joy to another?,1
"i myself very much enjoy gaining scientific knowledge, but i find making others happy and the pursuit of flow, the state of ones skill level meeting ones challenge, the things that make me the most happy.",1
"i also gain great pleasure from stories, relating to the trials of a character and his achievements, hopes and failures.",1
"my point is that you have a capable brain, and i judge you as being far from unimportant, both to our species and to myself.",1
"i want you to know that i responded to your post because it stimulated my mind, and not because i had the need to stop you from dying.",1
"your existence has meaning with me for a quality you are lucky to possess, not just because you are another faceless member of humanity and i have some broad sweeping principle idea that no humans should commit suicide.",1
"your existence holds meaning with me, and with others, and so i bid you temporarily excuse its lack of meaning with you and the universe.",1
"if you commit suicide now, it will be too late.",1
"i already have felt your existence affect my life, and because of that your own existence will have a hand in shaping my future existence, which will shape the existence of many others, inanimate or not.",1
"you cannot stop yourself from having existed, only from continuing to exist.",1
"you lost the chance to not affect the rest of universe during conception, and now you have no choice but to continue affecting it, one way or another.",1
"that said, i challenge you to the pointless task of living a full life and going out in a blaze of beautiful glory, having positively touched the lives of many others  and having achieved a goal that holds a grand measure of importance to you.",1
"you say that you cannot commit suicide until you are sure that it is the answer, and i say that just because you or i cannot know the point of our existence does not mean that there is not one.",1
"i invite you to live gloriously, pointlessly, and awesomely and this invitation will not expire.",1
"the thing is, black holes dont swallow space around them like a vacuum, they have a limited size gravitational field and masses outside of that field are unaffected.",1
"what i mean is, a black hole will not simply pull all objects towards it, only the ones within the reach of its gravitational force.",1
"furthermore, wikipedia states so, black holes dont last forever, they actually lose mass over time!",1
"when species compete with each other to adapt and be the fittest for survival, the real winner is always biodiversity for earths biosphere as a whole.",1
"a variety of species in many areas living many different ways increases the likelihood of life continuing, in any form, by reducing the risk of any single catastrophic event occurring.",1
"i guess my point is that life will strive to continue, and singularities dont last forever.",1
"if you follow the big bounce theory then all mass and energy would continue to exist following the next big bang, should the universe return to a singularity once more.",1
"there is a point to our lives as humans, and we will continue to struggle to claim our place in the universe.",1
im sorry my answer is more science-y and less therapeutic.,1
"if you feel you need some engaging discussion with someone who is willing to put forth the effort into actively seeking to understand your ideas, im more than willing to talk via pm or right here in the comments.",1
"sentient life with the ability to travel to and inhabit other planets  can manage to survive the appearance of a black hole occurring within its home solar system, and in theory survive like this providing it the ability to survive most celestial disasters.",1
"a universal cataclysm may be enough to take out a species or group of species living in such a manner, but we dont know enough about the end of the universe, or the possibilities of life experiencing extra-dimensional travel in order to truly say with any confidence what could happen.",1
"i find myself perplexed with my ideas surrounding life, for if it is designed  to survive cataclysms and disasters and black holes and the impact of other celestial bodies and continue to multiply and diversify and survive, i wonder at its purpose.",1
"i strongly suggest reading that book for a taste of his very interesting and stimulating ideas on evolution, both in the biological world and the inorganic world.",1
i should go back to it myself.,1
"alas, i will have to continue this discussion tomorrow, like yourself ive had a few drinks tonight, and more than my fair share of hoots this afternoon.",1
"dont lose hope friend, and i hope you can find a measure of solace in the knowledge that having a human being like yourself in the gene pool, who can actively ponder the philisophical dilemma of humanities ultimate universal fate is evolutionarily genius, and nothing but a boon for our species.",1
"you truly belong in humanity, and we are better for your presence.",1
i cant imagine how heavy this must be on you.,1
i can tell you love your family so undeniably much.,1
"you care, and that shows tremendous strength.",1
you are stronger than you know.,1
"two years, with your girlfriend.",1
"both of you, have stuck together for a solid amount of time.",1
"shes still with you, by your side, and you by hers!",1
"its okay to be afraid, its being human!",1
"you need to focus on what will get you ahead, school, education.",1
"focus on having fun, and leaving people that drag your beautiful soul down.",1
be strong for those who cannot be strong enough for themselves.,1
"when i feel blue, i re-arrange my belongings.",1
does she know the intense pressure youre under?,1
have you ever talked to someone about your anxiety?,1
i hope you both can read this.,1
reading both of these things and seeing you respond to each other is totally just crushed me.,1
it is so sad to see other people caught in between caring so deeply for others and caring so little for themselves that it actually becomes detrimental in itself.,1
"clearly, you both have huge hearts and you are full of emotion and it would really suck a lot if you guys werent able to share that with the world anymore.",1
"and i know you both probably arent concerned about my opinion on the matter, as you stated above, but i think you want someone to share it with you anyway, or else you would have posted in the first place.",1
"all the greatness to be had in your life is for you, and you deserve it.",1
the only thing that can make this situation as bad as you really see it is if you completely give up.,1
"you are clearly smart, and you are clearly talented, and whether or not you can pay rent in a couple months will not change that.",1
"your family loves you because you are those things, and they will always be more proud of your accomplishments than they will be disappointed in your setbacks.",1
just remember that you can do whatever you want.,1
"you have put a lot of effort into school, maybe its time to see the world or something?",1
"even when it feels like there arent any options, there definitely are.",1
try and get her to seek a therapist.,1
then maybe returningt there might be the first step.,1
"you should be w/ the family of your choice, not w/ people who clearly dont want the best for you.",1
you should take care of yourself for a while and while doing that maybe also put some distance between you and that girl - it might help you to put things into perspective.,1
no matter whether you believe in fate or god or anything:,1
that misfiring gun was a sign and im really thankful for it.,1
i hope you can use this extreme experience to your advantage!,1
sees something beautiful and uplifting:,1
you have a disease and it is so strong that even your partners love cant seem to stop it.,1
its not your fault and its not an unusual thing to happen.,1
maybe its really for the best if you outsource the job of taking care of you.,1
that could take the feeling of guilt off your shoulders and also relieve your partner of some of his responsibility.,1
you have two great things working for you at the moment:,1
the fact that amazingly human beings care for each other unconditionally and are even able to forgive the worst-seeming things.,1
"plus, the will to live that you expressed in your last paragraph.",1
"cling to these things with all the strength you still have, thats all you have to do, the other things are out of reach at the moment, you can care about them once you feel better.",1
its unfair that many people can just leave their beds w/o problems.,1
"it may seem like a miracle to you, it sure does to me sometimes.",1
"but everyones got special challenges in life and even those who jump our of bed wearing a bright smile each day might be confronted w/ difficulties once they enter a car, make a cake or whatever.",1
"even if not, even if their life seems perfect, they are bound to encounter some rocks on the road eventually.",1
"its one of the nastier ones, no question about that.",1
"but life functions very strangely and so i think you should try to hold on, try to take on day after another, try to battle against all the rocks that are in your way.",1
i know its worth it and im pretty confident youll find out the same if you just hang in there.,1
"believe me man, as many times as ive felt shitty  things have always gotten better.",1
"i think you need to just chill, you seem like a cool guy, appreciate the smaller things in life a bit more.",1
if you want to talk more just reply!,1
what is the disability if you dont mind me asking?,1
"you sound smart, and you sound like you need a job, which im sure you could get, if i was going to do anything silly, id certainly make sure id had a satisfactory life first.",1
"sounds cliche, but the worlds your oyster.",1
people in a worse situation have came out better.,1
this is literally the strangest moment in my life.,1
"im a 16 year old boy living in england, i came over the this  by chance and now i have the potential to change someones life.",1
in a weird kind of way youve just made my life better.,1
im going to have to sleep sometime so im sorry!,1
best of luck in the meantime :,1
im sure youre a real good guy.,1
im only an ear and a brain to you.,1
"com/r/suicidewatch/comments/pcarg/burden/this guy needs some help right now, im going to have to go.",1
"just kidding, seriously though, anytime.",1
thank you for taking the time to thank me and to comment on my comment.,1
"hey, so i just came over to this sub-reddit to have a look around and to try and educate myself on how other people feel.",1
"whatever you do dont pain yourself, it is such a big mistake.",1
"think of how amazing it is that youre here, not to sound to cliche but your left hand is made from particles of a different one from your right!",1
think of all the beautiful places and things that you can experience.,1
maybe you should take a few months break and explore.,1
do whatever youve ever felt like doing.,1
at this moment in time nothing should matter more to you than being happy.,1
i really hope you read this and hope that it makes a difference.,1
"im sure that there are many people to talk to, either on line, by call or in real life.",1
please dont do anything that will harm yourself.,1
should never be a last resort.,1
if you really felt this way you could always move away.,1
would you mind telling me what your pain is?,1
"i may not be able to get back to you for 20 or so hours, but please hold on.",1
"hell, try and hep some people in your own situation.",1
im sure potentially saving a life would be one of the most rewarding things possible.,1
"do it for everyone that cares about you, look at some pics of yourself as a child, think of back then.",1
what would that boy think of your situation?,1
"practice for a marathon, do some sports, damn, try bungee jumping, you may as well try them right?",1
"if you really feel like this, then i suggest you just leave her for a while, and go and do some things you find fun.",1
i mean if youre really that tempted by death then i think you should go have some fun while you can right?,1
im sure your girl friend would be so upset if you pain yourself.,1
"i honestly wish i was better at this, i just came to this place today and dont know how to say.",1
i feel that i have to try and help some people.,1
think of the simplest thing that makes you happy and keep thinking about it.,1
"looking at your recent posts you seem like a really nice guy, im sure that youre at least adding some value to their life.",1
you just answered your own problem man.,1
"i had a dream about somebody else having an epsiode, not me.",1
and i was trying to talk to that person and calm her down.,1
"it was really freaky and i kind of was shocked that i dreamt this, its like reality hit me in my dream.",1
i think you were/are focussed on it and thats why you dreamt it.,1
i feel like youre a lot stronger than you think you are.,1
"i figured, eminem totally gave it away, hahaim weird, i like deep house but how good is guns n roses?",1
"i love playing piano and guitar, so i know what you mean!",1
hey you know what works great?,1

"a show sounds good, how about going to one as soon as you can?",1
"can you go through a night without, have you tried it?",1
"if you dont care about them, then start enjoying your life.",1
there is nothing bad about being bisexual.,1

how about not killing yourself and start doing something you love.,1
"play those games, but just stay alive.",1
you can start a new life everyday.,1

try stuff out that you feel comfortable.,1
"maybe go and excersise, cook something, just anything that will help your racing thoughtshope this helps a bit, not the best at giving advice, haha.",1
i know our country isn\xc2\xb4t always accepting stuff and people.,1
i know exactly what it\xc2\xb4s like to be poor and feel trapped.,1

do whatever you need to do to survive and trust me you will.,1
your thoughts can change your life.,1
"if they were easy, it wouldnt have been love.",1
"you already survived a big part of your life, why not start a new life?",1

"go for a walk, listen to some music, rest your thoughts.",1
"wasnt a good student or a good offspring, but i really turned myself around my last two years of high school.",1
"i still got suspended two more times, for doing stupid things, but thats just life.",1
"as cheesy as it sounds, whatever doesnt kill you just makes you stronger.",1
"and i think that because you are still young, you will have plenty of chances to screw up and try to better yourself.",1
"i would actually encourage doing more stupid things, because they make for good stories later in life and they allow you do look back at what kind of person you were and give advice to people who happen to be in similar situations.",1
"also, when the time does come around, for you to help someone, you will see that this mistake that you made, getting arrested, is actually what is helping you help your friend.",1
"not gonna lie, youre gonna feel terrible over and over again.",1
sometimes you will lie in bed running through the arrest over and over again in your head and think about what you could have done or said to get out of it.,1

i encourage you to pm me so that we can talk more.,1

"if i go bald any time soon, im planning on working out at the gym and rocking the ripped guy/shaved head look.",1
"have you tried other ways to get your mind off of killing yourself, besides cutting?",1
"you have a lot of responsibility here, my friend.",1
"none of us know her like you do, and youll have to walk a fine line between protecting her and keeping her trust.",1
"talk to her, keep listening to her and get her to open up about it.",1
encourage her to talk about it with others too.,1
"think about people you can tell, if it becomes any more serious.",1
"a teacher, one of her parents, or one of her siblings perhaps.",1
dont hesitate to get help if you have any real concerns that shes about to harm herself.,1
"her safety needs to be the most important thing, even above your friendship.",1
i know this is a tough situation.,1
regarding whether shes exaggerating or making things up:,1
"if you truly believe that, trust your instinct.",1
"just keep in mind that maybe she really does need help, and shes trying to get your attention.",1
youre just being too confrontational.,1
"people are weird when it comes to stuff like that, but theres not much you can do about it other than adapting your approach when voicing your opinions.",1
"are you absolutely convinced that life is not worth living, or do you open to the possibility that you may, somehow, find a reason to live ?",1
"are you on here to confirm your beliefs, or do you actually have some hope that maybe you can change your perspective on life?",1
"i had to leave my girlfriend not long ago because i discovered she was cheating on me, among other things.",1
have you tried writing a letter?,1
"and, leave the suicidal thoughts out of it, unless youre seriously contemplating committing suicide and you need to reach out for help.",1
"in that scenario, however, i would recommend a family member or close friend.",1
"you know, if you do go to trial, a jury may believe your testimony and acquit.",1
"its a tough situation, but even if youre convicted, i really doubt youll get life without parole, given the circumstances.",1
"youll get out eventually, even worst case scenario.",1
i guess im just trying to be a bit optimistic.,1
"and all the rest of that stuff youre dealing with - dont feel so pressured, just try to help yourself through this point in your life.",1
ive literally never met anyone who actually thinks being a teenager was the best time of their life.,1
"maybe college, but not high school.",1
it sounds like you have a lot going for you.,1
it also sounds like youre dealing with some negatives.,1
"relationship with your ex, no pleasure from daily life.",1
"in january, were you actually happy, or had you just not reached the point of being suicidal?",1
has something changed since then?,1
"first, have you been entirely honest and open with the psychiatrist?",1
i congratulate you for seeking help.,1
i hope youre making the most of it.,1
"second, is there something to occupy your time this weekend?",1
"a hobby, or a place you could visit?",1
"but given your situation, i suggest making the most of the next couple days and truly trying to enjoy life.",1
forget the pressures and focus on yourself - theres no better time to do it.,1
if i didnt have school commitments id be completely down to do this.,1
"you know, to be honest, the  suicide has crossed my mind before in times of feeling angry or frustration, even though i would never actually kill myself.",1
"it is, in a sense, the ultimate means of inflicting emotional upset pain on others.",1
but think about who you would be hurting:,1
those who are capable of suffering upon hearing of your death.,1
you would be injuring the only people on this earth who do actually give a damn about you - and thats a common cold thought.,1
"even if youre really angry, and you truly dont care about hurting those people, you must also realize that the only fleeting satisfaction youll receive is prior to your actual death - after youre dead, you no longer exist and the pain you leave behind will not satisfy your urge for revenge.",1

"the best friend stuff is a bit tricky, ill admit that.",1
sorry to hear about how you feel.,1
how do you think he would react if you explained all of this to him?,1
"it sounds to me like youre in love with him for a variety of reasons, but most critically for friendship.",1
maybe he can be a better friend if he understands what youre going through.,1
regarding the  personalities you display:,1
they may not be  but maybe they have become extensions of the real you.,1
"if theres a chance of jail time for a criminal offense, he should have been given or offered a public defender.",1
youre uncomfortable with your weight?,1
"thats subjective, irrelevant, and youre surely being harsh on yourself.",1
why did you lump that in with  or  as if its bad?,1
"but i deal with it, and im in a very social career field that requires client interaction and public speaking.",1
can you elaborate on the problems youre facing?,1
"can you imagine a life that would make you happier, if you were to stop buying into what society has  you to do?",1
sounds like youre dealing with a lot.,1
"if youd like to talk, let me know.",1
"the medical stuff is out of my reach, but it sounds like youre a strong individual for dealing with it.",1
"leave on good terms, if possible , but if you hate it, dont stay.",1
"live for you, not for your parents.",1
"do what you enjoy , and become successful doing whatever that may be.",1
and your parents will eventually see that your choice was correct.,1
dont put so much pressure on your decisions.,1
"you may not believe me, but at 19, you have time to experiment and figure things out.",1
youre not writing the story of your life - youre still brainstorming ideas,1
"just because you dont get joy from what you have now, doesnt mean you wont find something in the future.",1
"lots of people feel like you do, but dont see suicide as a solution.",1
"sorry to be blunt, but youre wrong - it is entirely normal to enter college without a major or ideas for a career.",1
"in fact, most people complete general ed requirements at community college, then transfer to a university before choosing a major/career.",1
"youre exactly like most new college students, so dont worry about that.",1
"i know it doesnt help everyone, but have you seen a therapist or psychologist?",1
i also cant stand many of the people i encounter in my daily life .,1
"but my point is, i sort of understand where youre coming from.",1
and youre absolutely not the only person who feels this way.,1
is there anything you enjoy in life?,1
"anything you want to try, but havent ?",1
"what has prevented you from ending your life, if you recognize that you hate everything and your life is merely a product of society rather than yourself?",1
"i still havent overcome the feeling, but i guess im a decent actor.",1
"you might feel like youre weird for feeling like that, but the truth is, many people feel the exact same way.",1
one bottle of pills and im gonedoesnt always work out that way.,1
"dont assume suicide is a pleasant, simple process.",1
a footnote in the novel of lifeyoure still alive - you dont need to remain a  in the novel of human existence.,1
why shouldnt you kill yourself?,1
you havent discovered your reason to live - but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist.,1
"you havent found it yet, but i suggest that you continue searching.",1
"youre not the only one with debt, and other problems.",1
you can overcome those problems with time.,1
but youre not necessarily going to fuck it up down the line.,1
"maybe you have before, but that doesnt mean youre destined to fuck up every relationship or friendship you ever have.",1
"maybe you expect to fuck up, and that expectation causes you to over-analyze and overreact.",1
its a self-fulfilling prophesy - a prediction that causes itself to become true.,1
but it doesnt have to be that way.,1
sometimes a failed suicide is the surest way to appreciate life.,1
"people often experience suicidal thoughts and desires due to psychological problems, traumatic experiences, or temporary circumstances.",1
these feelings are often transitory or may be helped with therapy.,1
"if suicide is made legal , more people will take that option rather than pursuing other options, like seeing a doctor.",1
"i do, however, support assisted suicide, as an option, for the terminally ill.",1
the only person saying youre pathetic is you.,1
"im not sure what youre saying - are you thinking about suicide because unfortunate things are happening in your life , or are you suggesting that you want to kill yourself but you delay your plan because other people die and  you ?",1
"i guess what im saying is, why exactly are you suicidal?",1
"advocating a smaller world population is one solution - but its drastic and alarmist, in my opinion.",1
a criminal record wont prevent you from getting a job.,1
but you can find something worthwhile.,1
the good thing about criminal records?,1
"they matter less and less over time, and you can overshadow them with accomplishments.",1
"volunteer somewhere, get to know people at school and get fantastic recommendations from people.",1
"social interaction is weird in high school, you just have to deal with it.",1
you sound more normal than you may realize.,1
are you the only person shes opened up to regarding her suicidal tendencies?,1
"i suggest taking her seriously, to err on the side of caution.",1
sounds like you dodged a bullet.,1
how long have you felt this way?,1
"importantly, what motivated you to embark on this successful career ?",1
"how did you end up getting married, if youre so miserable and despondent?",1
"life is full of misery, but usually each instance is fleeting.",1
what sort of help are you looking for?,1
what is it that youre unsure of?,1
the fact that youre posting this means youre conflicted.,1
"nobody here will tell you what to do, but i think its worth mentioning that ending your life is not a solution, but rather an act of desperation when you havent yet discovered your other options.",1
"im sure anyone here would love to talk, myself included.",1
i noticed your statement about medication and feeling  why dont you give it a try - see what it may be like to feel ?,1
whats the harm in giving it a shot?,1
youre going to a psychologist anyway - why not go the extra distance and try medication?,1
why is getting into this major so important to you?,1
"so important, that you would actually consider ending your life without it?",1
"also, consider what you just said:",1
you would rather die than spend another year attempting to get into this major?,1
how can you justify that to yourself?,1
everyone is beneath mesocializing with the wrong crowd?,1
"otherwise you will likely ruin your victims life, the lives of your family members, and your own - when youre sent to prison.",1
but youre likely not strong enough to control your sexual tendencies indefinitely.,1
"you seem to touch on this, but id like to say it explicitly:",1
"surely living is better than nothingness, nonexistence?",1
"find what you enjoy in life, and pursue it.",1
maybe you just havent found it yet.,1
isnt that the start of a plan for your career?,1
at least you avoided working for a company run by total assholes?,1
"as someone in the medical profession, you surely realize that youre rather close to average, and many other men like you are in sexual relationships.",1
"cant you do something to change your financial situation, long term?",1
"also, there are many ways to enjoy life without money.",1
i know thats not easy to deal with.,1
i also sympathize with your diabetes mellitus issues.,1
"my sister is a type 1 diabetes mellitus, and i know how dangerous your experience was.",1
it does make this more difficult.,1
"the hospital probably violated their own rules and probably some laws, too, and i hope you never experience that again.",1
would you mind sharing some of your work?,1
"im actually quite interested in poetry, although i dont write it myself.",1
"it may sound easy to jump and just let go, but halfway down youll change your mind.",1
"it may be a struggle to find out why yours is worth living, but its a rewarding struggle.",1
"i agree, trying new stuff and forming relationships is a great idea.",1
but dont push yourself to do anything this weekend.,1
"the last thing you need is pressure, even if youre trying to do yourself a favor.",1
"i suggest breaking your routine, but without any expectations .",1
volunteering at an animal shelter could be both rewarding and enable you to meet people.,1
"in fact, im a big advocate of volunteering in general, for whatever cause matters to you.",1
you could even do something entirely out of character that youve wanted to do.,1
"go rafting, or skydiving, or make the drive to somewhere youve wanted to visit.",1
you know yourself better than anyone.,1
make this a weekend to remember.,1
how long have you felt this way?,1
"is it a cycle - do you feel this way at times, but not at other times?",1
you should tell us a bit about why you might feel this way?,1
why dont you enforce the court order to see your kids?,1
"you should live to see them grow up, at the very least.",1
"i think you should share that with your psychiatrist, but i also think you should be practical and make sure your terrible experience is not repeated.",1
do you have people in your life that could check in on you frequently if you are returned to a psychiatric facility?,1
"i would also share that concern with your psychiatrist, if you do mention your suicidal feelings.",1
"have you tried accepting how you feel about social interaction, instead of conforming to the majority expectation?",1
dont feel pressured to join social organizations if youre not a social person.,1
"its like not joining a football team if you dislike, or are not good at, football.",1
there are better ways to meet friends.,1
"also, im willing to bet your existence in this world is just as valuable as anyone elses, however you choose to measure it.",1
"i noticed returning to therapy isnt an option, financially.",1
"i think thats a good starting point, if were going to look for options.",1
"he has free will, and he chose to do it, even if you tried to convince him.",1
"if you would like to try talking to someone on here, im sure we would all like to hear from you, myself included.",1
"what is a typical day for you, and what bothers you most about the people with whom you interact on a daily basis?",1
"id be completely willing to let you take my couch, until youre employed.",1
"of course, i dont even know which country you live in, so that may not be practical.",1
it sucks because my parents deserve to see their son have kidsyour parents deserve to see their son find happiness.,1
dont worry about the kids thing.,1
you probably wont have kids for many more years anyway.,1
"dont even think about it right now, its a  sort of thing.",1
"i would rather just be happy with myself and have close friends, and maybe a dedicated job that would consume most of my time and help people.",1
"if you dont know what makes you happy, try stuff.",1
theres no barrier where you cross from childhood to adulthood.,1
you sort of just become an adult when you turn a certain age.,1
"im 23, and in many ways i dont feel any different than i did at 17.",1
"life is truly a learning experience, and its alright if you feel like youre constantly trying to figure stuff out.",1
"edit; fags as in cigarettes, im british!",1
yes -  carries a very different meaning in the states.,1
i think the most important thing you said was your acknowledgment that you suffer depression.,1
"maybe youre depression for legitimate, real reasons.",1
but it is also clouding your perception of your own life.,1
"for instance, i am willing to bet your friends and family do not consider you a burden.",1
im also willing to bet that your life can turn around and improve.,1
"so, why not make it mean something?",1
i just want to fucking be happy.,1
"i doubt you lack empathy, and its alright to be selfish .",1
"but it actually doesnt sound like youre selfish, if youre attempting to help your girlfriend handle her problems - even if you believe its a lost cause.",1
can you please explain why you are considering ending your life?,1
"it sounds like youre in a challenging relationship, and maybe youre unsatisfied with your current friend situation.",1
"but let me assure you, those are not good reasons to end everything.",1
"you may never meet any of us in person, but a lot of us on this subreddit genuinely care about the people who post asking for help.",1
are you studying something that could lead to an enjoyable career?,1
"what about your free time - do you play any sports, are you into gaming, music?",1
there are lots of benefits to living.,1
"i agree, but im not considering killing myself.",1
it sounds like youre level-headed and handling the situation really well.,1
are you having so much trouble because youre beginning to believe what he said may be true?,1
"i ask because sometimes a person, like your ex, can choose something that is loosely true and then twist it into something awful and untrue.",1
"and when you think about it, you may think,  thats abusive, and hurtful, and can be difficult to get over.",1
"its important to realize that his opinions and statements were totally meant to get a response from you, in a psychologically abusive way.",1
"this may not be what youre dealing with, but it is common, and a smart, rational person like you should be able to realize that he should just be forgotten.",1
youre 18 and headed to college.,1
"if you truly want, you can leave your current life behind - not by killing yourself, but by entering adulthood and planning a future which you can appreciate and which makes you happy.",1
"your life is about to change, for the better.",1
when was the last time you didnt feel suicidal?,1
it sounds like youre trying to make yourself happy by doing what makes other people happy.,1
"maybe you should change up your routine, re-evaluate your life, and ask yourself what may actually make you happy.",1
i just went through a very similar breakup.,1
im still dealing with it myself.,1
why worry about how other people perceive your features - just be yourself instead?,1
either through transitioning or not - there are people who will accept and respect you.,1
it sounds like youre seeing yourself through other peoples eyes.,1
"ive decided that the average person is quite stupid, and i would also argue that my morals are superior to those of others.",1
but humanity has its bright spots.,1
hes wonderful and i love him so muchyou have a couple of really awesome things going for you.,1
dont let your financial troubles overshadow the things that really matter in life.,1
"besides, things will get better.",1
"you have a degree, you have job experience , and you anticipate getting a graduate degree.",1
i bet in 5 years your life will be completely different - for the better.,1
you just need to overcome some challenges first.,1
"and really, dont compare yourself to others.",1
your boyfriends coworker has a new car?,1
"im in my second year of law school - im 24 years old, with a college degree - and i drive the same crappy 1996 accord that my parents bought for me in high school because it still runs and i wont have a  job  until i get my j.",1
i learned long ago to stop comparing my possessions to the possessions of others because it really doesnt matter.,1
i would rather be angry then sad.,1
"your strong,amazing and resilient.",1
i never thought about suicide but i have had some pretty shitty thoughts sometimes.,1
to me it looks like u need a fresh start.,1
"find a hobbie, sweat it out with exercise.",1
focus on the little things that make you happy.,1
make those things a big part of your life.,1
doesnt matter what you look like.,1
give the universe what u want in return.,1
i like to make a list of what i want in life and go for it little by little.,1
"now go play a video game, smell or fart under a cover, watch a good movie.",1
you seem pretty fuckin awesome to me!,1
"and another thing if you feel you dont have enough friends you should sign up to some sort of club, so you can meet for people; a tip i got from someone else.",1
"i think it would be extremely selfish of you to end your life when there are people out there that actually care about you like your five friends, and i would feel pretty bad and guilty if you did commit suicide because i would feel responsible because i couldnt do anything to help.",1
so you know that there are people that do care itll get better i promise.,1
"like i said before, this kind of things dont ask for your permission anyway, so.",1
"things do get better, you have your whole life ahead of you.",1
"as for making friends, theres no technique.",1
a lot of people will appreciate that:,1
"having said that, feel free to pm anytime.",1
"well, it happened once, it can happen again.",1
dont close yourself to new opportunities.,1
"you cant show them, theres nothing to show.",1
"you can tell them and explain why you see the need to do it, to move out.",1
explain them this shouldnt affect your friendship.,1
"as friends, they should understand your needs, and put them ahead of that need to live all together and party everynight.",1
"if they cant see it, its their loss.",1
"i know it can be frustrating, and it may take a long time.",1
"but, believe me, you need to keep trying, even with no experience youll find something.",1
at least something temporary until you find something better for you.,1
"like i said, you should talk to her.",1
"she may be scared of talking about it, she may not know how to approach you about it.",1
it does sound like a terribly pain situation to be in.,1
i really cant tell you if that would be the right thing to do or not.,1
"it is risky to tell her how you feel right now; yes, it would let her know you are there for her, in case things change; but it could harm your friendship with her and her boyfriend.",1
"you know her, you should analize every little possibility before doing it:",1
is she going to feel awkward and maybe stay away?,1
", is she going to tell her boyfriend?",1
", if she does, will he get mad or just stay away from you?",1
"its up to you to decide, if you are willing to take that risk because not saying anything hurts more, then go for it.",1
"whatever will be better for you in the long run, what will be easier for you to cope with.",1
i bet its terribly hard to even think about it.,1
and its also hard to put ourselves before other people too.,1
specially if you invested almost 5 years of your life in the relationship.,1
"if you have more time and less worries on your head youll be able to focus on getting a job, and a place to stay.",1
this will also be important for you to have a better relationship.,1
"if not with her, then with someone else; but the key is to feel good about yourself and who you are before anything else.",1
you probably wont care for a while.,1
"but this kind of things dont ask for your permission, they just happen.",1
"you are young, youll find someone else, and if not, someone else will find you.",1
"relationships are crazy like that, when one ends we lose faith in them, but then another one starts.",1
"youll be ok, and if you get your life in order, and feel good about who you are, youll find someone that fits perfectly into your new life.",1
do you have any idea of what made you feel depression in the 1st place?,1
"well, thats what id need to know to tell you what id do!",1
"if we had a really good relationship, and i really cared about him, i would keep it to myself.",1
"the other option, , would be to push him away a lil bit.",1
"not out of majot bitchiness, but avoid hurting him or having him in situations where he might fell bad.",1
i guess it depends on whether they are one of those couple that share eeeeverything with each other or not.,1
what are your plans for next year when you turn 18?,1
well i wouldnt expect you to want to right now.,1
you still need to figure out what to do with your current relationship.,1
"all im saying is, once you make a decision:",1
"thats the wonderful thing of love at 1st sight, it just.",1
"love is also something to look forward too, just stay positive and look at all the things that are yet to come.",1
"well, as a girl i dont really know where you can meet girls.",1
but i can tell you i did meet my boyfriend online .,1
i find it to be a good way of meeting people:,1
you can find people that lie; or people that will be absolutely honest because they have nothing to prove to you.,1
"i know being alone can be tough, and in your case, having someone so close to you that you want, but seems so unreachable at the same time.",1
"i dont think you can go out looking for love, but, just put yourself out there, and it eventually finds you.",1
"sometimes it takes a while, of course, but when it comes it will be worth it.",1
"i know i probably didnt help much, just wanted to tell you not to give up, love just has a way of appearing when you least expect it.",1
for what i read your friends seem to be acting kinda childish.,1
"it shouldnt be that big of a deal, nor should affect your friendship in such a way.",1
"you have a great girl, and the opportunity to find a better place that suits your needs.",1
"if they arent willing to accept that moving out is not some kinda of betrayal, then it doesnt seem to be a real friendship, you know, at least from their point of view.",1
"i understand your feelings towards them might be sincere, but friendships cant be one-sided.",1
"try to work things out, but all in all, its up to them to see that they are making a huge drama-fest out of something thats not that bad.",1
"in my opinion, the first need thing you should try, is to not feel ashamed.",1
"you did nothing wrong, what you did, you did out of love.",1
its the person who you trusted that should be.,1
"we all have failed relationships, and the feelings that you have:",1
"feeling used, worthless; are pretty much on the normal side.",1
but you need to talk about it to overcome those feelings.,1
"you should try your parents, after all, you already came out to them; and what happened to you, happens to a lot of people, and it hurts the same way to everyone of them.",1
being conservative shouldnt prevent them from understanding what you are going through.,1
"if you still dont feel confortable with them, you always have a bunch of strangers right here that are willing to listen to you.",1
"i know it sucks, but you really didnt do anything, that would make them act like that; be sure you are not the problem here, they are.",1
hopefully theyll understand that at some point.,1
id say you give her the chance to tell you how she feels.,1
"then again, for what ive read, your relationship may not be at its best right now.",1
"just see what she has to say, im sure youll be able to figure out what to do after that.",1
"if you dont think shell be part of the solution, she is probably part of the problem.",1
"and i know its hard to hear, but if shes not gonna help you out, you need to move on and focus on yourself.",1
"same here, you can pm if you want.",1
"well im a lil older than you, and we cant exactly hang out.",1
but you can pm me if you wanna talk.,1
"well, you have been capable of establishing a meaningful relationship before, so be sure you can do it again.",1
"also, im assuming you just finished high school or are about to, youll meet lots of new people from here on.",1
dont be scared to open up to new people:,1
"you did it already, you can do it again!",1
"feeling like you owe people for things in your life shouldnt make you feel trapped, but grateful.",1
"remember when people do things for you, its because they care, not because they expect something in return.",1
"if your family didnt want you around, they wouldnt notice the absence so much; if they do, theyd probably like to have you around.",1
"id recommend you to drop them a line, let them know how you are feeling; if they know, theyll be able to show their support.",1
"dont think you are not good enough, you dont have to live by anyone standards but yours.",1
"make clear whats important to you, and stay true to that.",1
its hard to go out and finally get out lives started.,1
"im trying to get a job too, and its difficult , but you just need to keep trying, perseverance will bring results eventually.",1
"probably once that happens, you will start feeling better about yourself, and that will definitely help to make relationships with the people around you better.",1
"talk to your girlfriend, you feeling like this is probably affecting her and the way she acts around you too.",1
i dont know how i would act if i found my boyfriend with a gun in his hand either.,1
"tell her how you feel, and ask her to help you stay motivated to do all the things you wanna do.",1
well i thank god for that battery and i am happy to be talking to you.,1
"can you tell me what first made you get into photography, what was your first photo that you thought was good?",1
"from my experience, when people tell you you are a genius they mean it, because it makes them feel stupid when they do.",1
"from what you say it sounds like you really like to innovate, create new and useful things.",1
"i can totally get how it feels like a renaissance, there is so much potential in all the knowledge we have.",1
did anything interesting or important happen today?,1
"i cant imagine how much it sucks to have no bearing, and to have oversight of the huge dissagreance in america.",1
what rift is between your father and best friend?,1
"lazyness and lack of motivation can really suck, especially when they are screwing up something you want.",1
"what do you think made you spoiled, does it have to do with your dad?",1
strong religious ideologys can really suck when you disagree with them.,1
is it to do with your girlfriend?,1
i most certainly am happy to be talking to you.,1
do you still like it when looking back?,1
was that the first time you really thought about suicide?,1
"not knowing your situation well enough, i cant say that your life will without any doubt get better.",1
"that said, it most certainly can get better and if i were a betting man, id bet that it will.",1
"but lets get to know you better, why do you feel like you have no clue what to do?",1
"and how do you feel like you are a burden on your family, do you think they would agree?",1
"that sounds reasonable, some things do indeed need taking care of.",1
i also just wanted to say i think its really brave of you to come out here and share all this.,1
it must be very hard to let others in on these feelings.,1
it must suck to feel like that.,1
do you think you could help me unerstand why you feel like a failure?,1
its great that your talking with her.,1
"also, what kind of mind altering stimulant?",1
"if you never told anyone else, did you find it dificult to come here and share your story?",1
"its not where i started, but i do really like it.",1
"if you dont live with him, where do you live, and in what circumstances?",1
awesome that you are going to see someone for help.,1
have you talked to your girlfriend about your suicidal intentions this time?,1
i think she could really help you because she knows you.,1
"have you ever told anyone else about your suicidal tendencies, or tried to?",1
"if you say you might be an idiot savant, do you also think you are autistic or something along those lines?",1
"also, the leys looks beatiful on google maps, and i actually think i remember cats college.",1
it must really suck to have this happen.,1
i wish i could understand how you feel but i probably cant.,1
as a start though id like to know more about your situation.,1
i imagine it sucks losing all your friends.,1
i cant imagine how scary the prospect of that happening again would be.,1
"if i read this correctly, you accidentally passed on a secret to someone who shouldnt know the secret and people found out.",1
you also say youve never considered it until today.,1
"did you never consider it at all, or never this seriously?",1
"i really hope youll help me understand, and perhaps help.",1
i really really hope that you dont.,1
"i probably still dont get how much your life sucks, but i still feel that you should go on loving.",1
"people care about you, people who want to help.",1
"yeah, i think many cases of autism are overgeneralisations or just a stamp to put on people.",1
what do you mean when you say ?,1
"it is really great when you can get that right alignment, right environment and just soar straight ahead.",1
it just makes you feel like one of the best people on earth.,1
"yeah, money does give that feeling of being scored, evaluated.",1
"i have to go now, sleep and some really pressing chores.",1
thank you for giving me some insight into you.,1
it has been a pleasure talking to you.,1
sounds like a lot of awesome stuff.,1
i certainly agree such things are a reason to stay alive.,1
"and if you feel up to it, why do you feel this way?",1
sorry for taking so long to reply.,1
do you hold back with your therapist because you dont really know her enough yet?,1
and i noticed you didnt mention talking to your mother.,1
and what exactly caused your desperation this time?,1
the news that you werent going to cambridge?,1
"yeah, money can really be a hassle and a huge burden when you dont have it.",1
how would a kind of honor system work though?,1
would indeed be awesome to have one.,1
its said that your mother is egoistical and argumentative but it seems like she is at least there for you.,1
"i have to go now, dinner, sleep, work etc.",1
"ill probably be back tomorrow, i liked talking with you :",1
i would have loved to even just have helped a bit.,1
it means a lot to me to mean a lot to someone else .,1
"im wondering, how did you go from latvia to cambridge?",1
"that sounds like a serene picture, was it?",1
that is fucking shitty to have your father be in pain and not find help.,1
do you think that perhaps time will heal his wounds?,1
there is certainly a lot of pain in the world.,1
"seeing a father in trouble is really fucking shitty, there is just something about a father that means he shouldnt be in trouble.",1
"fuck man, my dad has ms and there is really no proccesing it.",1
do they hate you for knowing or telling?,1
how long have you felt this way?,1
how far have you considered your suicide?,1
"for example, do you have a method or a time in mind?",1
he probably isnt ignoring you because he doesnt care.,1
hes doing it because he is afraid to care.,1
and he couldnt handle this fear so he decided to pull away.,1
hes just to afraid to acknowledge this.,1
because then he has to help you and that means facing his own demons.,1
"he rejected you, not because you deserve it, but because he was to much of a pussy to accept you.",1
if someone doesnt love someone else that is more often enough because they are afraid to love.,1
it doesnt mean the other person is to blame.,1
"the fact that you have opened your heart to someone, and are now opening yourself to the world via reddit.",1
is more than enough to me to say that you do deserve to be loved.,1
"you clearly have a huge heart, and care a lot.",1
that alone makes you a great person.,1
lastly i want to thank you for sharing.,1
"i am going through some stuff of my own, and you opening up has given me more courage.",1
"it seems like you have a lot of people helping you, and your even making progress.",1
so now i dont feel i really understand why you are suicidal.,1
please dont get this as me saying its not that bad i wouldnt dare suggest your not really suffering.,1
i simply want to understand why you are.,1
documental as in journalistic?,1
also do you share your photos with anyone?,1
"9 film cameras is a lot, why so many?",1
"what happened for your father to be dissapointed in you, it seems really harsh what he did.",1
"do you see him often, do you live with him",1
economics and maths can be really boring and psychology is great because you get to look into how people work.,1
"i myself dabble a bit in photography, what kind of photography do you prefer, and what kind of camera do you use?",1
"buisness studies does stand out a bit though, why did you choose it?",1
"instead of thinking about killing yourself, just pack up your stuff, and leave.",1
"dont let this be the end of your life, but the start of a new one.",1
"dont , find a hotel to stay at, hitchhike, rent a car, whatever.",1
and your family probably doesnt think of you as a burden.,1
"imagine a burden you would be if you killed yourself; depression on everyone, further financial problems with funeral costs and such, etc.",1
you will be sent into oblivion forever.,1
"no, you wont know it, but you will not exist anymore.",1
"not eating, breathing, running, anything.",1
make your existence meaningful and dont throw it away carelessly.,1
i hope you can find your way out of this.,1
you would rather take your own life than die from drugs.,1
society is fucked up and i hate having to conform what  and  to society.,1
"sorry if i come off as annoying, i just know there are better and more options than just choosing death.",1
"basically getting away from this awful sounding family of yours and finding your own purpose in life, instead of letting it slip away.",1
doesnt mean you should give it another try.,1
"give life another chance, i believe in you.",1
"despite all of these shortcomings, youve still managed to make it this far.",1
"haha, as they say you can do anything you put your mind to!",1
although ive always felt like the people that work there are like the snotty clique at high school.,1
"although i may feel bias because i work with waitresses, and unless youre a regular or a fellow employee, they always just slightly treat you like a second hand citizen.",1
"im awfully tired today, sorry i wasnt tired conversational this time about.",1
seems like we could both use an extra helping of sleep.,1
"the thing is with holes, theyre a lot scarier then they really are.",1
people think that  they loose track of themselves and get caught up and amplify a sitaution that isnt that bad.,1
"go out to a place where you can clear your head, whether its a hill with a view, a coffee shop, or even your room with a clipboard.",1
forget about everyone else and everything.,1
no ones more important then yourself.,1
"i sat down last year and by the time i was done, i had 6 pages of basic to complex things i wanted to do and how to do them.",1
"now i dont want to force anything upon you or give any wrong ideas, but thats what worked me.",1
"damn, wheres the humanity these days?",1
"i hope nothing was damaged, have you gotten everything back in hopefully one piece?",1
a lot of that could be due to stress.,1
a friend of mine is taking some ap physc classes and stress has been known to defunct a persons ability to process everyday cognitive abilities if it becomes too much.,1
kind of like when theres not enough ram on a computer and you que up too many processes.,1
"but of course im not a professional, although if you ask me it sounds like what you really need is a vacation.",1
"and please, a tiny mess like this is more than a match for someone of your technological expertise.",1
"ive actually been up to pretty much the same, ironing out the kinks of life so to speak.",1
"finally cut my hours at work, it was just too stressful and left me with zero free time between that and school.",1
im not sure if i mentioned it but i was accepted to my university of choice so ive been preparing for that to start sometime in the fall.,1
"and since id fallen behind in school due to work, ive really just spent the past few weeks studying for exams i had last week, and passing in missing assignments.",1
"the only other highlight being i bought a guitar, so hopefully ill learn how to play that.",1
not every exciting yes but between life and being around negative-three degrees out most of the excitement is waiting to thaw .,1
im still looking for the proper cure myself.,1
has pretty much become my catch phrase.,1
"if you ever want to talk let me know, i can give you my email.",1
its almost comforting to see that.,1
"its just hard having that kind of click in your head, after working hard and with the notion that if your going to do something; make sure it matters.",1
"ive always been a firm believer in myself and my morals,  so while i understand, and i probably will, to just suck things up and move upwards and onward the best i can is going to be the most obnoxious thing for me.",1
"hey man, i know its rough when school is such a focal point of todays society.",1
im a senior myself and i find myself teetering over the edge on the grade scale too.,1
"no one ever said itll be easy, but thats why theres people like us.",1
"you see, people like us are the game changers.",1
"were the ones that make an impact, regardless of how large.",1
"we build our lives into something were proud of, by doing so inspiring others to follow.",1
"i know work, and money, and school all seems pointless but were only 16-18% done with our lives.",1
"i know it sucks not being able to do what you want, i went through the same phase of  your parents are really looking out for your best interest, trust them on this one.",1
and lifes just one of those things where youre going to get back what you put into it.,1
you wont know exactly what youll get till down the line but if youre confident in the moment then what goes around comes around.,1
"trust your parents, build your life into something your proud of, and remember that when you apply yourself anything is possible .",1
"thats spinning a definition to,  unfortunately being a guy i dont have that kind of opportunity.",1
"short of being a bank robber, ill be sticking with the entry level jobs for the time being lol.",1
so its not even like a  winter where its 60 out and hasnt seen snow for 3 weeks.,1
"although what i really would be okay with, is an atv with a plow.",1
"go riding, make money, and do it in style?",1
it just felt silly i suppose after talking for a while to think,1
why does every landlord ever have to be a kleptomaniac or the staring villain from a horror movie?,1
"they either want a billion dollars to return it, or your life.",1
"however it seems you are more than ready to start swinging back, more power to ya!",1
did she take anything too important/crucial to everyday duties?,1
"im not trying to pry, but care to share why?",1
"i completely understand if you rather but i swear, im just genuinely interested.",1
"and its not that big of a deal, but i just feels nice having fresh.",1
"kinda like when you put fresh clean sheets on the bed, its just so relaxing.",1
i guess a lot has happened since we last talked!,1
"theres the factory where you kickass, the aquarium that sells fish, i can only imagine what the third one might be.",1
and just know that its always bumpy when you make a notable change like moving .,1
"things will usually straighten out with a little elbow grease, and if they dont 9 times out of 10 youll at least know what you need to do to straighten them out.",1
its been way too long and im sorry about it.,1
"but with the holidays, school, and work, it felt like i was on a treadmill that just stopped yesterday.",1
"and hows the job going, get that promotion yet?",1
"its the new year and im one of those people, the whole fresh start and what not, so while i normally i would go through and pick up the conversation where it left off, if its okay with you i rather start anew.",1
"not saying i dont want talk about those things, but i just need a new beginning you know?",1
"i usually pour myself into the year, so come thanksgiving is when i kind of auto-pilot my way through whats left of the year from pretty much complete social, physical, and mental exhaustion.",1
"i promise our correspondences wont die out and now that things have slowed down a little more for me, i wont take months to reply.",1
"and while unfortunately i still have work in the morning, but ive felt terrible knowing i just didnt have the time to sit-down and write a reply you deserve.",1
i wish i could say ive done something productive but all ive really done outside my normal routine is sleep.,1
"just so tired of people, bullshit, people and their bullshit.",1
hell im even getting tired of myself a little bit.,1
"hows the whole 54528 jobs, 3 distinct hobbies, and finding time to rest working out?",1
it would be kind of funny if you turn out to be the next emperor or supreme chancellor or whatever canada has.,1
have you gone/any tips for someone whos never gone before?,1
"ha, alas im not mentally mature enough  just yet.",1
"although it would certainly be an interesting piece to include, or potentially leave out, on the resume lol.",1
there are times i just want to go out and shovel the paths myself.,1
"i have no problem with the common cold, but the trails are so iced up they cant be traversed.",1
just slide and tighten them over the toe and ankle and shazaam:,1
i can only imagine what its like to get kicked by them.,1
"exactly, conversation can be apreactive a little more if you can appreciate the aspects of said pperson.",1
"ha nice, petty revenge at its finest.",1
dont worry about the small reply.,1
working 3 jobs and putting up with lifes daily crap will tire even the best out.,1
i much rather see you take time to catch up on sleep or take a mental health day.,1
we all need to spend a weekend every now and again just doing what makes us happy.,1
"whether that be reading and watching fish for a day, or arctic survival hiking trip.",1
"seriously though, dont try and just shrug stress off.",1
"one moment you think its well managed and you got it easily under control, next day things are looking a little grim as every little problem becomes a problem.",1
"i have a lot more free time so if you ever want to just talk in a pinch, or just vent everything off from big issues to little problems.",1
its comforting to see im not the only one who sees things this way.,1
"that knowing youre conducting your train right off a cliff, and theres not too much you can do about it.",1
"when it comes down to it, i love money.",1
perhaps its just because of the freedoms it grants.,1
"but really all the money i earned would go towards an early retirement fund, just so i wouldnt have to worry about working pointlessly anymore.",1
"just kick back, and do what i want when i want with my friends.",1
"i go hiking fairly often, i love the fall scenery from atop of a mountain.",1
"being outside, fresh air, etc.",1
"comparatively to the wilderness, ive lived a pampered life.",1
i dont know a damn thing about any kind of survival/wilderness training .,1
"ill admit im happy now, im content in a way.",1
"but it has to end eventually, and while my life isnt at the grinding away point yet theres nothing to say it wont in that 5-6 year time.",1
im not drunk so its not like i cant these thoughts off as just the alcohol.,1
"and while i may not be physically on the verge, ive more or less come to terms with it mentally.",1
"id like to keep talking, thats for sure.",1
"and im flattered by your offer regardless of how actually serious it is, im one of those its the though that counts kind of guys.",1
"i understand if youve had a change heart, it appears we dont exactly line up like a puzzle pieces.",1
"although id confidently say youre right, we agree our money obsessed society is by no definition a complete pleasant one.",1
"just when you think its gotten bad enough, our bedding is starting to be made of plastic.",1
"well thats relieving to hear, im always in the market to meet and talk to new people.",1
im sorry to hear most of your high school friends have departed.,1
"as an only child i treat my friends in the close group we have now as my brothers and sisters, i can understand how much it sucks to not be able to see them everyday.",1
"which i suppose ill be in the same boat as you once we graduate midnext year, everyones kind of floating down their own rivers.",1
canada has some pretty awesome wild-life and nature sites.,1
maybe what you should do is next time you have an extended leave  you should plan an extended camping trip.,1
it feels like youre stuck in the mud kind of?,1
and even when you do get free you dont know which road it is you should go down?,1
"maybe what you should do is, since  you clearly love to be outside and in the wilderness is do just that.",1
"save up for a while, buy what gear you need and just take hell even a month to do and be where you love to be.",1
"if you like it, and things are working out then so be it!",1
"wow, i feel really stupid now.",1
its certainly a form of motivation to keep better track of it thoughxp.,1
and by the way you worded it sounds like your next exactly moving up and over.,1
"as the saying goes, you cannot have beauty without pain.",1
gotta love dem cherry blossoms right?,1
"i cant say im entirely familiar with any native japanese citizens or visited, but ill take your word theyre fun and more so full of life.",1
"and of course, the bads going to show up anyway so theres no point in giving it more attention then it deserves.",1
"im sure youve probably heard this enough times, but im sincerely sorry that you didnt have a close relationship with your mom.",1
that sucks a lot and my heart goes out to you.,1
"if its any consolation, you seem like an awesome person in the end of it all.",1
ive traveled up and down the east coast more or less for the past year and ive never heard of them till now.,1
howd you get into this whole fish scene anywho?,1
i just dont hear of many people say why not right?,1
i mean plenty other of people have stupider books on stupider topics that sold a plenty.,1
not saying your book would be stupid but hell if theyve done it why not you too right?,1
that just made the list of worst fears.,1
that night i was just feeling lemony.,1
"i have flavor swings, go figure.",1
"i agree, it would just take me sometime to get use to letting go.",1
"i find it hard to be wasteful of that 2c, only where id be subconsciously adding it up and like 2 times a week it would dawn on me.",1
"and yes, i have a love-hate relationship with auto-correct.",1
"hey there guy, i know im clocking in a little behind here but i hope its not too late pal.",1
"im going to tell you a little story, i hope you dont mind.",1
a few weeks ago i walked out into the woods with a gun and planned on doing the same-thing.,1
"i was tired of people, bullshit, people and their bullshit.",1
"so think about this, think about all your friends and family.",1
"im not trying to guilt you, but ultimately no-one wants to see you do the deed.",1
i still cant get my head off this one girl i know.,1
shes just so awesome but doesnt want much to do with me.,1
but friend it just isnt worth it.,1
"please, what will i have to do to prove it to you?",1
stay at it on behalf of us who cant get those awesome reminder tattoos.,1
so one of the things im thankful for is just having someone i can just talk to and vent away with.,1
"whether thats a library, family room, xbox with friends their dorm.",1
"thats worked for me so far, although that isnt a permenant solution.",1
"alright, if i was every person that carelessly left every small detail out of place what would you tell me right now?",1
"go ahead, just whatever comes to mind.",1
"whether its a good verbal scolding or whatever, just have at it.",1
"no one in their right mind should enjoy feeling like a blob on society, thats what makes taking a day or vacation off so hard.",1
although its also whats suppose to make life so easy.,1
the biggest problem is i dont know what i want love to do.,1
"i have fun all the time, but ive yet to really find that one thing im utmost passionate about.",1
"but like you said, i am going to spend the next year or so figuring that out.",1
"and youre right, it sucks that the things youre good at are things you want almost nothing to do with.",1
"but the money thing, it wasnt until i got a job about 6 months  that i could start buying things that i simply wanted.",1
"and it didnt take months of saving to earn up to it, i just go out and say  i dont want a rich life, i just want a content life that isnt restricted 80% of the time by money.",1
"its just i dont want to dig myself into a hole, and know the entire time im doing it.",1
theres a dangerous amount of money people are willing to spend on subscriptions and stuff like that.,1
"makes me jealous in the sense that, i wish i had money to just throw around like that and live an easy life.",1
"its almost like waitressing during the holidays, but year round.",1
"but if you ask me, people need to get outside more.",1
theres a lot of cool persons out in the world if you take the time to meet them.,1
"which granted figure the worst a person will do is tell you to get lost, it doesnt seem all that bad.",1
but im sure someone would argue that point with me.,1
"this kind of just dawned on me, but weve been talking for a few months now and i realized we dont exactly each others names.",1
i totally understand if you rather not share but i can say i am genuinely curious as to what it is.,1
"thanks man, is your username japanese by any chance?",1
im really sorry to hear it sounds like youre getting kicked while your down.,1
"but think of it like this, me being the enternal optimist that i ; take a step back, and just look at everything you are paying 100% for.",1
"be proud of every problem thats been resolved for now, because no one can take credit for that but you.",1
"second job, now thats taking some initiative!",1
"i hope your aquariam store interview goes well, i mean for filler work it certainly sounds like youd be happy there.",1
"and it just seems like no matter what i did, shit just wouldnt get done or if it did get done, something bad would happen thus ruining it.",1
"today for example; i get my check and plan on going home to treat myself to a computer game ive been planning on buying, and i get in a car accident.",1
"its not even my fault and no one was pain fortunately, but my car has since been towed just in time for winter.",1
not like i needed it or anything.,1
"the worse part was while i was waiting for the paper work to get cleared up, this stupid business owner forced my friend who was giving me a ride out of the parking lot because she has so many customers that need to freely go in and out.",1
"granted all he had to was move out to the street, but its just pointless bullshit that ruffles my feathers.",1
"it was completely uncalled for, and i think thats upsetting me more then my destroyed rear-end.",1
sorry to just dump that on you but i felt like if i didnt get it out it might cause an ulcer or something stupid like that.,1
"i think part of the problem, asides from the fact ive been extraordinarily bias, is that i havent found good sushi.",1
"granted i havent tried any on the basis i havent had the right opportunity, which kind of turned into me avoiding the opportunities.",1
what does an eel taste/feel like anyway?,1
is it the black slimely mealy sterotype i have in my head or something completely different?,1
"its bad enough on my phone, i cant imagine being restricted on my pc too.",1
"its okay youre not a bad canadian, as long as you say sorry more then you need to then youre all set.",1
"i mean it wouldnt pain to pretend to like hockey, but personally i can over look itxp.",1
"and to be fair, who doesnt love cider?",1
"man all this talk of fish almost makes me want one, but i have enough trouble with my dog.",1
"would you say that the personality in fish are really brought out in groups, or even if alone you can pickup on it if you pay attention enough?",1
"damn, these guys are like the walmart of pets.",1
i could see how easy it would be to get into fish or any kind of animal when you have one these 10 minutes away.,1
"its super easy, like really its just ketchup, white vinegar, oregano, basil, italian seasonings, garlic powder, and few other spices.",1
i caught a glimpse of it when i was shopping and having just bought a sweet and spicy i just couldnt bring myself to get it.,1
sorry about the extreme belated reply.,1
"felt like this week i climbing up mud, no matter how hard i tried i just couldnt gain any ground.",1
i know i appreciate it more when i think  rather then  &amp;  i werent aware fish were that smart so to speak?,1
do they follow specifically you or just any ol blob by their tank?,1
doesnt get much more relaxing.,1
"or maybe not entirely experience, maybe just a broader imagination?",1
perhaps write a series of fiction survival stories?,1
"i usually make my own bbq sauce, but when im just doing something sharp pain like burgers or something i love their sweet &amp; spice.",1
"its like theres an accounting department in part of my head dedicated solely to the amount of money i have saved, and the amount of money i could of saved.",1
50 and make massive profit and retire early!,1
thats very generous and supporting of you.,1

"if the answers you give are correct, whats the issue?",1
"you may say its ok to cry and to feel, but as a doctor i cant do any of that.",1
i cant do any of that as a med school student with anyone from my class.,1
"i mean, obviously if youre a doctor you cant let yourself break down in the middle of a medical procedure youre doing or such, but that doesnt mean youre never allowed to feel or anything like that.",1
"and again, for what its worth, im listening, so you can talk with me whenever",1
the way i understood what you said about  was that you werent ready to play for the public.,1

"hey there, i just wanted to let you know i was reading all this i want to take a bit of time to think through, digest all of it, and so on before replying, because theres a lot, but i didnt want you to think i was just disappearing or ending the conversation or anything.",1
just will take a bit of time for me to think through and reply to all of this.,1
ill right away say that what youve described to me doesnt strike me as sociopathy.,1
"i also wanted to say that it might be good to stand up for yourself, at least enough for you to realize that you dont owe him continued interaction, and definitely not going along with him to church or whatever.",1

"just, well, youve been stress and a depression and stuff.",1
"sorry i didnt answer you before, was afk.",1
maybe the too tired/worn out is more literal than the sense in which you intended it?,1
"ie, maybe need to work on getting to sleep earlier, etc etc?",1
"and its okay, you dont have to be sorry for not knowing.",1
im just asking since am trying to understand more.,1
"and for what its worth, i am here.",1
i can certainly understand that fear.,1
"but yeah, im really glad youre doing better.",1
perhaps its less inevitable than you think.,1
"or perhaps we will resume our conversation tomorrow, and perhaps that will help you.",1
"so please, dont give up on life, okay?",1
"for now though, i need sleep , and i really hope to continue talking with you tomorrow though.",1
and its hardly causing a scene if theres an actual issue.,1
"just mention it first thing, mention the thoughts, etc.",1

what sort of stuff happened in au?,1
"and yeah, you definitely need to get out of that environment.",1
"hey, ive been wondering how you were doing.",1
\\offers a hug\\and dont worry about pushing me away.,1
"if i may suggest, get back into the habit of washing yourself, etc.",1
"not for the sake of any social rules or such, but because it might help _you_ feel better.",1
"i imagine the folding the bed sheets and stuff more help to give structure, to give specific things to do, etc.",1
"as far as people you already know who are acquaintances, well since you already know them, that might be a good start, to try to hang out with them?",1
"either way, im here and listening.",1
"and, stupid idea maybe, but have you tried taking _short_ walks during the day?",1
"ie, start with just, i dunno, ten minutes out, then maybe a bit more the next day, etc?",1
"as far as foods, therere plenty of things that you dont have to fry/using a frying pan for.",1
"not sure what else to suggest, but am here and listening.",1
"ouch, and yeah, i can easily imagine that being frustrating.",1
why would i pain or scare you?,1
and why do you think its too late?,1
"\\hugs again\\ if alone, maybe call someone?",1
"\\nods\\ i meant if it was an issue with understanding, maybe i could help.",1
"other than that, try to get better.",1
am trying to think of any way to help.,1

"please avoid harming yourself further, and either way, i dont think youve failed.",1
"well, first, make it clear to yourself that your intention is to live.",1
maybe see if you can get on unemployment or something?,1
do you have any records at home that may help you figure that out/remember it?,1
so couldnt you in theory go and just get another copy of it?,1
"her mind is lost, scattered to entropy.",1
"you can say it was her choice, but then it is also emsy666s choice to object to it.",1
"and yes, it really is a tragedy when someone is lost, either by their own hand or by another means.",1
"if nothing else, then when by their own hand, it is a tragedy that they were in such pain, such suffering, that they felt that was the only solution.",1
ugh as far as your blood sugar bouncing and the rest.,1
i dont like that you started blacking out and stuff.,1
make sure to get plenty of rest and get better sharp pain.,1
"hey, maybe you need a change in your meds then, or something?",1
"im not sure what else to say right now, but please dont give up.",1
"just an idea, but maybe try not identifying with the depression?",1
"i mean, treat it as something part of your brain is doing _to_ you?",1
dont say  but rather  or such?,1
"sorry if this seems a bit incoherent, is late here.",1
"might be going to sleep soon, but wanted to at least let you know that someones reading this.",1
"ie, specific things going on thatre upsetting you, or just feelings of depression not really caused by outside situations as such?",1
"good that youre going to call the hotline, but please dont hang yourself.",1
"please, i really hope you choose to live.",1
"am listening too, but yes, please call then.",1
and let us know how it went and how youre doing.,1
"this may be a dumb question, but any chance you could move somewhere else instead?",1
im here and listening either way.,1
"your kids care about you, right?",1
i think theyd rather help you deal with that then lose you.,1
what about possibility of moving closer?,1
poke the financial aid office and see if you can get more given that you lack the money?,1
"sorry, s probably arent as helpful right now, dunno.",1
"just give it a bit of time first, and not in a  but",1
"if it makes you feel like a hypocrite, then maybe.",1
imagine the advice that you yourself are giving now is being given by someone else to you?,1
"lots of things, dont have the energy to explain it all sorry.",1
"well, whenever you want to tell me, im listening.",1
"mm, just makes it feel hopeless to keep trying.",1
"but either way, am here, and i do think its worthwhile and not hopeless.",1
i think part of the issue may be that you keep telling yourself that.,1
one way ive seen it put/generalized was something along the lines of this:,1
i believe theres one on afternet,1
"well, start at whichever part comes to mind first, i guess?",1
\\offers a hug again\\ im glad youre holding on for now.,1
but you also seem to too quickly assume people hate you.,1
"no, itd cause massive arguments and not achieve anything.",1
"it would help if he approached relationships rationally but he does not, unfortunately.",1
"ie, if you just showed it to him, asked him to read and basically said  or otherwise wrote it out for him?",1
maybe try posting in  too and describe the situation between the two of you.,1
maybe someone there would have some additional insight.,1
"youre not alone, you have friends.",1
"you have that friend you told me about, im here and listening, etc.",1
"actually, may just get to bed early tonight myself, so am here for now though.",1
what happened and hows he doing?,1
you want to talk about your life?,1
whatre your interests anyways?,1
"and yeah, youre right, both sides need to work to maintain it.",1
i hope it does work out though.,1
"and yeah, hopefully youll get your violin soon.",1
and wanting encouragement doesnt sound stupid to me.,1
"someone that knows something about psych meds and might, if needed, be able to prescribe something that may help?",1
"i do understand the feeling about wanting to deal with it yourself, but.",1
\\nods\\ id just say that perhaps you shouldnt overly underrate your chances of meeting someone like that again.,1
"so seriously, please dont give up on life, okay?",1
i honestly dont know what to say except that im here and listening.,1
"as i said, a little bit at a time, dont think too much about how much there is left to do.",1
as far as your chest being tight/having difficulty breathing all week.,1
do me a favor and see a doctor about that.,1
"might be panic, and you said you had a lot go on this week.",1
"well, you said youre tired alot, so.",1
"as far 1890-1960s america, you mean you like stories from that time period or stories _about_ that time period?",1
could be just difficulty getting stuff done.,1
"but yeah, if you read that article, then maybe try saying  and make a point of not doing so?",1
"either way, please stick around?",1
"and as i said, if you want my email address or phone number or otherwise want to talk, either here or privately, just lemme know, okay?",1
"if youre bored, do you know why?",1
what sorts of things would you find potentially interesting/nonboring?,1
"but, well, think of it this way:",1
"if i didnt care, would i be talking with you right now?",1
"if you want to talk privately or whatever, pm me, if you prefer email or phone or whatever, lemme know.",1
"just please stick around, please dont kill yourself, ok?",1
why do you think no one notices you?,1
"and, well, for one thing, knowing more about you might give me a better understanding of whats going on.",1
"but if they really can help you, perhaps best to actually let them help you?",1
most people are not very understanding however.,1
that doesnt mean you deserve it.,1
it just means theyre not very understanding.,1
i applied for a job today which is.,1
"well, its a very simple job, just walking dogs and caring for peoples pets whilst they are on holiday or unwell etc, but it would be some money, and id get to spend the whole day with dogs rather than people which suits me pretty well heh.",1
"i dont like to mention this stuff out loud, at all, so although my boyfriend is aware of what happened to me and he knew i was upset by the scene in the movie i couldnt really tell him about it, and i dont have any way of.",1
"talking about why it bothered me, i guess.",1
"i havent read the book or seen the movie, but i can half guess at least what sort of things you might mean.",1
"i wanted to put it on my website but i did make it for him, technically, and it is his now, so i feel like i should have his permission before displaying it there.",1
"yeah, thats the one i was thinking of.",1
"as i said, i thought it was nice.",1
i realised it has been several months since i first posted here and youve talked to me pretty much the whole time.,1
"thank you for that, its really kind of you.",1
it is ok if you are tired of me heh :,1
p i dont want to waste your time with my crap.,1
"again, nothing to be sorry for.",1
"and no, not tired of you, dont worry.",1
"and youre not wasting my time, really!",1
"actually, i wanted to ask you if you wanted to pm me your email address so we can keep talking even if reddit misbehaves",1
"no prob, and let us know how stuff goes, okay?",1
"as i said, good that youre going to be getting help.",1
oooof that youre feeling so bad though.,1
"well, i guess it depends on the sort of work, right?",1
"but some places/jobs even suggest 4 day work weeks, i think.",1
"actually, if its okay to ask, what kinds of things are you interested in?",1
"what do you find interesting to read about, learn, do, etc etc?",1
"just so i understand, the entirety of the  is that you swore once?",1
"realistically, if you go to teacher and show this person has been deliberately harassing and stalking you, practically trying to push you into being suicidal, and that person responds by telling the teacher, , itd be _you_ thats in trouble?",1
"if thats the situation, then id say go straight to trying to take legal measures against this person.",1
"at least, thatd be my suggestion, though ianal.",1
"maybe instead of thinking in terms of , think in terms of if it seems to, on average, increase, then you are doing better.",1
"but while you were trying, life was, well, yeah.",1
"i dont think you failed, i think its a work in progress.",1
"and again, maybe try doing something thats fun for you.",1
some physical activity might be good.,1
not sure what to tell you other than .,1
i hope that goes well for you.,1
"ah, there you are, so didnt delete account, just post?",1
"and id suggest first calling your local crisis hotline, and/or going to hospital and simply telling them your financial situation",1
how is your life a horrible mess?,1
"what you listed certainly is _not_ any reason to kill yourself, imho.",1
"theyre things you need to work on, though.",1
"as far as , well, you and the entirety of humanity.",1
"work on improving that, though.",1
"i mean, you said you dont know how to keep living.",1
"so once youre feeling a bit better, , we can talk and see if we can figure out ideas that might help you, okay?",1
"hey, just wondering how you yourself are doing?",1
"maybe im making some mistake, maybe those cities are large enough that depending on where you live in stirling and where the con is in wheeling , could be much farther.",1
"but yeah, youd know the area better, of course.",1
i was just doing sharp pain searches/estimates of distances to see what i could find.,1
"maybe some of the weak/lower doses ones might be good,  or maybe something else.",1
"and yeah, as far as messiness and so on, i know what thats like",1
"if youve been up that much, that would affect you.",1
"and i understand the feeling about wasting talent, but right now you can work on stuff.",1
"i didnt say youd find a clone of her, i said that its reasonable that youd find someone _different_ but still _just as good_.",1
com/r/suicidewatch/comments/7sw8v/so_the_pills_are_right_here_on_my_desk/c07bay0what hes doing after is what concerns me.,1
i dont really want to see a therapist.,1
"only reason that it could potentially be useful is to put some clear definition to what my stupid brains doing, but i have not found mental health professionals to be particularly helpful in the past, and dont really want to see them.",1
"ah, maybe misremembered, then.",1
"maybe try again and find different ones, hopefully more competent?",1
"i havent been referred to a new diabetes mellitus centre yet, but yeah, hopefully they will be good doctors.",1
\\nods\\ ask your new gp to refer you to one?,1
"i dont think there are specific things, but i dont know.",1
"finding it hard to think properly, which i guess feels kind of distressing all by itself.",1
\\nods\\ i think i may understand the feeling.,1
"i feel stress about being a bit behind on uni work, and about having to go back to london tomorrow, and be with people all day tomorrow.",1
i feel mentally tired from today as it is.,1
"wait, you mean be with people when you get back to london, or be with people where you are now?",1
and i know what you mean about getting behind.,1
"i guess try to just work on it some, step by step.",1
i cant do all the things im expected to do very well and people dont give me a break about it.,1
its so exhaustion trying to get things right and i dont manage to get it all right even when im trying hard.,1
i wish i wasnt expected to try to behave like people want me to.,1
"i dont want to, and i just get it wrong anyway.",1
and i end up feeling like a stupid idiot and feeling angry.,1
"at least here, and with my friend, i dont have to try so hard, unlike in real life.",1
how do you figure youre useless?,1
other than trouble finding work  what things are you having trouble with that people expect you to do?,1
and ooof that people give you a hard time over it.,1
"well, as i said, maybe they could help you find work at least?",1
"as i said, not sure what to say, but i am listening.",1
"perhaps initially dont even reveal that its making you suicidal, just explain that this stuff is going on with you, and that you need some help?",1
"besides, you and he are different people.",1
maybe in other ways youre stronger.,1
"any chance it was just net misbehaving, so either he saw you leave first, or his bye didnt get through or something like that?",1
"but yeah, i think i can understand why itd pain.",1
the magic words you want to do searches on is  try to find some psychiatrists or therapists that offer sliding scale treatment.,1
"just to verify, do you mean that figuratively or literally?",1
"\\hugs\\ i can understand you might not want people to see you the way youre feeling, but it might still be good for you.",1
"but maybe get cleaned up a bit, get some real food into you, maybe get some sleep.",1
"and yeah, i know what thats like about needed to know someones there.",1
i think the scared alone thing might be a type of loneliness though.,1
"at least, so it seems to me, though i might be wrong.",1
"i want to help, but i honestly dont know what to do, what to look for, what to say.",1
"hey, im not sure what to suggest yet, just letting you know im here and listening, and suggesting not to lose hope.",1
"if you are able to, upon consideration, spot that some of your behaviors make you bad/mean, then you could perhaps learn to change those?",1
"im not sure what to say, but i am here and listening.",1
"well, if youre up for talking about it, how do those make things worse?",1
"and yeah, keep practicing by chatting here, as a start, if that helps.",1
"either way, i am here and i care.",1
"not sure right now what to say, but am here.",1
"well, even if theyre different, they should still accept that you are how you are.",1
"maybe they might want to help, but to simply give you a hard time about it and stuff is a whole other thing.",1
"\\nods\\ i guess that kind of makes sense, but as you noted, its only been a week now, so maybe snuggling up with a good book or such would be enough to help you relax and fall asleep once you get used to it?",1
and what sorts of stuff you like to read?,1
"and is there any stuff in specific on your mind, or is it   the feeling of depression without any specific things youre depression about?",1
"well then, while it wont solve everything, you right now know part of the problem.",1
"so dont panic, just take a normal course load next semester.",1
"is there other stuff currently on your mind too, incidentally?",1
"hey, im not sure what to say yet, but wanted you to know i read this and am listening.",1
\\offers a hug\\do you think there might be some way for you to arrange to see your daughter even given that you and your girlfriend are taking a pause in your relationship?,1
"im not sure what else to say, but am listening.",1
and good that youre good at dealing with the sugar spike and such.,1
"am glad youre doing better, and no prob.",1
"yes, our existence is  a physical process.",1
you are not a  to your experiences as much as you are  your experiences.,1
"i have to state again, if i arent deciding, then randomness is, so where is the free will?",1
i think youre confusing me with another commenter.,1
im saying that _you_ are deciding.,1
#NAME?,1
its not some alien thing thats controlling you.,1
i love watching peoples minds be changed by words.,1
i suggest stopping doing all the things you hate.,1
stop keeping your weight down.,1
you can be awesome at any size.,1
"better happy &amp; alive than educated and dead, right?",1
"if the alternative is death, you can afford to shuffle around all your priorities.",1
find a way you can make a difference in an area you carry about.,1
"volunteer at a homeless shelter, or a museum, or a collaborative art project.",1
join a community about something you love online and spend all your waking hours working your ass off to make it awesome place to be.,1
blow your savings on a trip to a country youve always wondered about.,1
"whatever it is, find a place where you can be a force for good.",1
feel free to pm me if you want more specific help finding something:,1
i promise there are good opportunities you havent considered!,1
"it is nice, but largely you are supporting reddit.",1
"this guy managed to come from some of the worst emotional upset and physical abuse and, though much of his life has been really shitty, has really made something of himself now.",1
"hes inspired thousands of redditors, and his own life, at 43, is finally starting to turn around.",1
"its a long road, but he didnt get any special help.",1
"first, know that many, many people have felt the way you feel and worse, and have managed to come through it and put it behind them.",1
"who knows how long it will take, but it is possible!",1
"now, imagine how valuable this experience will be when you finally make it through:",1
"i dont know how old you are, but imagine another fifty or sixty years of a life in which you will be able to call on this experience to help other people through their own suicidal thoughts.",1
"you do not deserve this, and im not going to tell you its a  or anything, but you can turn it to your advantage.",1
"your life is an enormous resource, and throwing it away only seems win-win in the short term.",1
you have so much potential to do good in the world!,1
use a little bit of that $30 to help someone else out.,1
"just go out and find another human being who needs something, and give it to them.",1
"dont expect anything return, though it may come.",1
the mere awareness that you are capable of doing good even in these diminished times may help more than you think possible.,1
"and even if you do remain hopeless, at least you will have done something good for someone else :",1
what have you done to try to work things out between the two of you?,1
"as difficult as it is, sometimes we need to apologize to the people who are important in our lives even if we dont understand what we did to upset them.",1
you and your brother dont see eye to eye regarding your mom.,1
talk to him privately and open up.,1
tell him where youre coming from and how you feel about the things she says and the way she treats you.,1
the only way this is going to work out is if you can be as objective and sincere as possible.,1
im trying to relate my brothers experiences with what you went through.,1
"i know its not the same, but its the best i can do to understand where youre coming from.",1
"even two years ago, there were times when he wouldnt want to go out in public.",1
it was a struggle for my family watching him go through that.,1
im trying to make sure youre not in the same position.,1
"yeah, it seems pretty common, doesnt it?",1
"everyone looks at other peoples struggles as simple, yet we cant get through our own.",1
"no, they look at resumes  at career/internship fair.",1
a lot of the questions during the interview were behavioral .,1
its not about always being happy.,1
sums up my thoughts on being sad.,1
thats where your strength comes from.,1
"even if you dont want to practice a skill/hobby or go out and exercise, you have the time for it, just not the motivation.",1
"if you have nothing going on for a few hours, go to the gym or take a run.",1
focus on seeing improvements over time.,1
dont be afraid to talk to some of the people you run into while youre working out.,1
"i know its the internet, but you came to us with a serious issue and you were ready to talk it out; go out and talk to someone about wanting to get into exercising.",1
"people love to talk about themselves, ask them what they do when they work out.",1
itll give you some insight as to how to structure your workouts.,1
"like i said, lifting gives energy throughout the day.",1
there are other studies out there about how it improves your mood too.,1
"i know its difficult to start, especially with depression.",1
make a schedule for yourself and stick to it.,1
"not just for lifting, but for everything.",1
"it helps you keep track of everything youve done and if you can stick to it, it will help you accomplish your goals.",1
whats going on that you have trouble dealing with?,1
my parents have done a lot for me too!,1
i know theyd be devastated also if anything were to happen to me.,1
have you thought about talking to them and telling them how you feel?,1
"i know my parents would do everything they could to get me help, and it sounds like yours would too!",1
"if youre in the mood to listen to something, try .",1
"maybe youve heard it before, maybe not.",1
"its not a song, but its close enough.",1
"other peoples perceptions of you can be important, but youre placing too much of an emphasis on what everyone else thinks.",1
youre on the right track by looking for a job.,1
its not easy for anyone right now.,1
"obviously, try to find work relating to your skills or hobbies, but dont be afraid to try new things and take advantage of other opportunities.",1
"its really difficult to change from  to  if you pay too much attention to others opinions of you, youll start to realize that youve wasted your time on people who dont matter.",1
do the things you enjoy and like-minded people will start to enjoy your company.,1
"im not trying to argue, just genuinely curious.",1
"but if you dont want to talk about it, thats fine and i understand.",1
my point in my earlier comment was just that you should try not to judge everyone before youve gotten to know them.,1
"we not all bad, and many of us enjoy helping others :",1
i just turned 21 and ive lost my friends before too - more than once.,1
i could write a book just about my feelings and emotions when that was going on.,1
"the way your stomach turns and eyes flicker when you say something to a friend just hoping theyll acknowledge you, let alone try to talk to you and carry on a conversation.",1
"you read into everything they say, looking for an underlying meaning.",1
"looking at their body language for signs, watching them turn away from you or distract themselves on purpose just to avoid saying something to you.",1
"were young, and all we want is to be accepted.",1
"not by everyone, just by someone who cares.",1
"i dont know how old you are, but when i was 16, i realized i didnt have any friends.",1
it took me four years before i was finally convinced i could disappear and no one would notice.,1
it took me a month of telling myself im not here for them; im here for me.,1
i was in a room with people who i didnt know and who didnt know me.,1
i didnt set out to make friends.,1
to be myself - open and honest.,1
"i was tired of tiptoeing around the people i spent over a decade of my life calling friends and teammates, worried about their opinions of me.",1
i didnt have to hide myself because i didnt have friends.,1
i had to be myself because i had nothing left to lose.,1
"as for your mother, we have more to talk about, if youre up to it.",1
"i have the same thoughts, to some extent.",1
i question a lot of my friends motives because i feel like theyre doing something behind my back.,1
but you know that not everyone is out to pain you - your boyfriend proves that.,1
"its a difficult process, but it might be easy if you lean on your boyfriend and family more than youre used to so you can begin trusting people.",1
i just turned 21 last week; im in my junior year of college.,1
"ive got a few things im dealing with, and coming to this sub and helping people out makes me feel better about myself, in addition to giving me some clarity.",1
you are the female version of me.,1
theres so much in this story that i can relate to and would love to talk to you about it.,1
"unfortunately, this is not a story i want to share with everyone.",1
feel free to pm me if youd like.,1
theres a lot id like to get off my chest with someone whos in a similar position.,1
i just read up on it on ; it says your moods can change drastically - there isnt much of a progression from one mood to the other.,1
"im not a doctor or anything though, so i might have read that wrong.",1
definitely call your doctor to get more info.,1
they understand the relationship between you and the drug better than anyone on here could.,1
"that being said, stick around and talk if theres anything else on your mind :",1
"i dont know about you, but when i was in shape, i cared about what i ate in addition to working out.",1
"since i started working out again recently, ive been a lot more careful with my nutrition.",1
"the days i dont work out, i eat like shit.",1
"if you want to get back to 220, youve got a lot of work to do.",1
"when you wake up tomorrow morning, weigh yourself.",1
"whenever you have a break, if its before or after your shift, go exercise for a bit.",1
"if you start feeling hungry, drink some water first to .",1
eat healthy after youve worked out.,1
try to keep busy between meals.,1
"that means if youre not being productive, stay away from food.",1
work out again if you have the time.,1
the key to avoiding eating too much or eating unhealthily is to eliminate the activities you do that cause you to eat stuff thats not good for you.,1
"then i started eating smaller things, like candy bars.",1
stopped playing video games and started reading.,1
havent had much of a problem since.,1
"work out every day, as much as you can.",1
"if you have to get on the treadmill three times a day to avoid junk food, do it.",1
put yourself through hell for one week.,1
"next wednesday when you wake up, weigh yourself.",1
"if that doesnt motivate you to keep going, i dont know what will.",1
its not fun to go from feeling like youre on the top of the world to wondering why no one seems to care about you.,1
i broke up with my ex-girlfriend the summer going into senior year.,1
"nearly four years later, i havent dated anyone since.",1
"a lot of people think that 15, 16, 17 is too young to fall in love.",1
"but the purpose of dating isnt to fall in love, its to find what youre looking for.",1
so we broke up three years ago?,1
im not letting it get me down.,1
im thankful i had her in my life so i know what is it that i want in a girl.,1
im not wasting my time going through serious relationships.,1
im enjoying the time i have with my friends before i meet someone i want to spend every moment with.,1
the things we deal with in our families are what make us who we are.,1
the experiences ive had are going to make me a better parent than my mom and dad.,1
"no ones perfect, not even our parents.",1
learn from their mistakes and move forward.,1
"every time you think of lighting up a cigarette, go for a run, read something in the newspaper or online that interests you.",1
do whatever you need to do to take your mind off of whatever it is thats making you crave a cigarette.,1
"if you have time, go to the gym.",1
start caring for your body and youll slowly lose the bad habits.,1
try talking to them about the individual issues you have instead of bringing up the topic as depression.,1
im sure theyll try to help you through each of the problems thats causing your depression instead of trying to tackle the overwhelming problem of depression.,1
i have trouble motivating myself too.,1
maybe things would be a little easier if you set simple goals for yourself.,1
"make a list of the things you want to get done, and check everything off the list as you go.",1
its surprising how beneficial it is to see yourself go through task after task.,1
there are some great subreddits that can help a lot with that stuff too.,1
check out /r/getmotivated and /r/getdisciplined.,1
but maybe your parents arent the people to talk to right now.,1
do you have other friends and family you rely on or you feel comfortable talking to who would be interested in helping you?,1
this person has been unsuccessful finding a job so far.,1
im not telling them to stop trying.,1
"right now, they need someone to talk to so they dont get caught up in their thoughts.",1
"in addition to getting references for future jobs, op is going to meet people who will care about the situation hes in and help him - in a much better way than anyone on here can.",1
"in addition to being able to eat three meals there, he will network and meet people who have connections to help him find a job.",1
"i think regardless of all other options, volunteering is a top choice.",1
"however, i would love to hear your suggestion.",1
"im sure you and your friend have tried some of these things, but its important to remind the people you care about of the role they play in your lives.",1
sit down and think about what would have been different and what would be different in your life if your friend were gone.,1
"its one thing to tell someone how you feel, but its another to show them with a hand-written message - something that took you time and effort to complete.",1
"for your friends fianc\xc3\xa9, it would be a list of the reasons why she wants to marry him.",1
"for you, consider recanting some of the best memories the two of you have.",1
you could also think of taking him to a place where he can help others.,1
"i enjoy going to the animal protection league, regardless of whether or not im feeling depressed.",1
"by going to the apl, i know im making a difference in animals lives.",1
it makes me feel better about myself.,1
what youre doing is a good thing.,1
"it might be difficult for you, but helping someone in this situation is always a challenge.",1
good luck and thanks for what youre doing!,1
"if youre unsure of whether the people close to you want you around, you need to find other activities that make you happy.",1
"when i dont want to be around people, i go to the gym, read a book, watch ted talks or youtube videos to learn something new.",1
maybe those things arent for you.,1
"maybe youre more artsy and like to draw, paint, sing, or dance.",1
"regardless of what it is that you do, the people in your life will come around.",1
"they wont be with you all the time, and thats okay - its normal.",1
"but while youre waiting to spend time with them, you need to figure out who you are and what interest you.",1
"and when they do come around, youll have plenty to talk about.",1
i have no idea where ill be working or living once i graduate.,1
i think i have a little bit more of a right to be more scared than you haha.,1
fourteen was a rough time for me too.,1
i was around so many people who i didnt know that i became quiet.,1
that was the beginning of me losing friendships.,1
"i havent been following your story, but i skimmed through your post and comment history to get a better understanding of whats going on in your life.",1
i come here when im feeling down to help others.,1
but i start to feel better about myself when i talk to people who are feeling the same way i am.,1
"youve been through a lot more than i have, and youre considerably younger than me despite both of us being young.",1
"its awesome that you found dante, and that he has given you something to live for!",1
"if youre an animal lover like me, you should check out the animal protection league .",1
i volunteer there over breaks and i love it.,1
its awesome to meet and play with the animals; and its bittersweet when they find a home and you dont get to see them anymore.,1
"from what i gathered from this post and your comment history, you dont have a place to call home.",1
the first is to talk to your guidance counselor at school.,1
"legally, they need to do something about you being homeless, especially since youre a minor.",1
the second is to go to a homeless shelter and see what they can offer you.,1
i would only do this if youre certain you dont want the school and city to get involved with your familial life.,1
"the third option is to keep going to school, get involved with the apl and similar organizations, and make friends with some of the other workers.",1
im sure they will be able to help you.,1
its amazing what type of relationship people have who volunteer at the apl.,1
they are the type of people who enjoy giving back and are connected by their love of animals.,1
youre not the only person whos experienced a force relationship.,1
"to be honest, sometimes i feel like im the one forcing the relationship with my family.",1
i also feel like some of my friends are forcing themselves to be my friend.,1
"it completely screws up our ability to trust people, doesnt it?",1
"when i feel down, i dont turn to my family because i never really have with emotional upset stuff.",1
i dont turn to my friends because i dont feel like i can trust them and i dont want to come off as attention seeking or whiny.,1
so i come here and listen to other peoples problems.,1
it takes my mind off of my life for a while.,1
i think you need to take your mind off of whats going on in your life and focus on something or someone else.,1
"instead of watching tv, go to an animal shelter and volunteer.",1
"youll get to play with some pretty cool animals, meet people who are genuinely nice, and get away from everything youre dealing with.",1
dont forget to work at your grades.,1
you want to do college right the first  time.,1
work so you dont have any regrets about the grades you have.,1
"its difficult to do when there so much going on, so make sure to get your mind clear first!",1
its just another bump in the road.,1
"unfortunately, there are more to come.",1
"i hope this helps, and i want to continue talking!",1
i have to get to sleep though.,1
"regardless of how far into college you are, theres always an opportunity to start over.",1
"thats a big task, but i did it three years ago when i started college.",1
"if i had to, i could do it again.",1
"you get to a certain point when you realize youre not happy with whats going on in your life or the people involved in it, so you slowly change.",1
act the way you want - be yourself.,1
meeting new people is exciting.,1
"even as a junior, im still attending meetings for clubs i never gave much thought before.",1
its cool seeing and listening to what other people care about.,1
it takes my mind off of some of the stuff going on in my life.,1
how long have you felt this way?,1
are you in a bad place because you feel this way or are you feeling this way because youre in a bad place?,1
what caused you to attempt suicide five years ago?,1
"im sorry to do this at this point in the conversation, but i have to go to sleep.",1
how does your boyfriend feel about this?,1
does he understand your position?,1
what makes you comfortable having a boyfriend if youre not comfortable around people in general?,1
sorry if these questions sound harsh.,1
"im not trying to be rude, just generally curious!",1
why do you think youre ruining everything?,1
i always feel like im bothering my friends or that they dont want to be around me.,1
has this situation been the only thing that has caused your friend to feel this way or has he referenced suicide in other situations?,1
"if this is the only time he has said anything about suicide, i would recommend you guys constantly talking to him through phone, sms, facebook, etc.",1
till the situation gets better.,1
try to make your friendship as normal as possible despite the financial hardship.,1
hopefully this will remind your friend of what life was like before everyones financial struggles.,1
its good to know you got something out of it :,1
"good luck with everything, and let me know if theres anything else i could do!",1
im just trying to show you that there are other ways to be happy.,1
do you have weights or a gym membership?,1
or are you gonna start with cardio?,1
do you need someone or something to motivate you or do you think getting in shape is something youll be able to commit to?,1
did you have a bad experience growing up that led you to not trust people?,1
ive had a couple that makes me uneasy around friends.,1
what is it about being around other people that bothers you?,1
lack of trust or shyness maybe?,1
i think im the same way to a lesser extent.,1
"i dont want to impose, but i want to be included.",1
"i dont want to seem clingy, but i dont want to seem uninterested.",1
"i just want friends who care, and for some reason theyre difficult to find.",1
"if youre truly happy talking all the time, but dont want to because you think it will make others not want to be around you, who cares?",1
"you need to find people who genuinely want to be around you, and those people exist, you just need to go out and find them.",1
"your friends are going through the same thing, and you might end up going your separate ways.",1
"when i figured that out, i was going into my junior year of high school.",1
it wasnt us going our separate ways as much as it was them not wanting to be around me.,1
"without any friends, i had to be myself and find people who like me for who i am.",1
whats the worst that can happen in this situation?,1
youre not going to lose any friends if they are distancing themselves from you already.,1
ive felt the same way more than once.,1
"three years ago around this time, i was your age, and in my last semester of high school.",1
my parents went out with some friends and i was home by myself.,1
"i called a couple of them, but it was 8:",1
"a year earlier, i figured out that the friends i had grown up with wanted nothing to do with me.",1
"they were nice enough in person, but they didnt invite me anywhere, they didnt initiate conversations, they didnt care.",1
"after crying for an hour, i got on my computer and went to the one place where i had hundreds of friends, all in one place - facebook.",1
i dont know why i got on facebook.,1
"to pretend i had friends, i guess.",1
"it didnt matter that all he said was  what mattered is that he said something, anything.",1
i went from as low as ive ever felt to being as excited as a little kid on christmas.,1
"so far, that wall of text means nothing to you.",1
"but as someone whos been where youve been and is going through something similar now, let me tell you what i wish i wouldve done sooner, eventually ended up doing, and currently wish i could do again.",1
"i know when i was in junior high and high school, all i wanted to do was be around my friends.",1
it didnt matter if we were just hanging out and watching tv or if we were going to an amusement park - i just wanted to be with them.,1
one of the things my dad tried to tell me is that people dont just want to be around you because youre you.,1
they want to be around someone who doesnt need to be around them.,1
"my junior year, after i figured out no one liked me, i opened up; not in a deep, personal sense, but in the sense of being social.",1
"i joined the rugby team, a volunteer club, and a political club.",1
my junior year was the most fun of my life.,1
"but once that ended, all my friends graduated.",1
i made some friends and ended up having a great time.,1
"then i went to college, and there were so many people to meet and new friends to make.",1
ive driven friends off more than once because ive been clingy - in junior high / high school and now again in college.,1
"if someone wants to talk to me, they can.",1
but i dont go out of my way because i feel like im intruding.,1
"i wish i could go back to the way i was for that one short year, but i cant.",1
i dont want to start over again.,1
"i did it once in high school, i did it again when i came to college - i dont want to do it a third time now that im almost done with school.",1
dont look at this like you have no friends.,1
look at it like you have every opportunity to go make more.,1
"go to the gym, take a piano lesson , learn programming, join a new club, hang out in your teachers office after school to talk about an assignment or lesson and shoot the shit.",1
open yourself up to everything.,1
stop fucking caring about talking to your friends.,1
"and when you do, dont read into what they say.",1
"by going out and inventing yourself, youre creating an opportunity to meet new people and youre giving your friends an opportunity to come to you asking questions about whats going on in your life.",1
the happiest i am is when people genuinely want to be with me because i make them happy.,1
and i  do that by being someone whos interested in everything and willing to try new thingsi wrote this as much for me as i did for you.,1
what types of things make you feel better?,1
"even if it doesnt put you in the greatest mood, what lightens your day?",1
sometimes we have to take a step back from the big picture and appreciate the small things in life.,1

now im so much happier and doing better in school.,1
it may not be the same for you but i just want you to know that it gets better.,1

it wont happen right away but if you simply apologize youll be taking the first step towards being able to live with your mistakes.,1
"im really sorry, that sounds frustrating.",1
youre doing a really good job for yourself!,1
you have to play the cards you are delt and live your life knowing that you are you for a reason.,1

"dont worry, youll find another job.",1
just go to sleep for a while and work on fixing your job situation later :,1

you have to hold on and things will get better.,1
"things get better, and then they get worse, and then they get better again.",1
thats how life is and you have to learn how to .,1
i had a tough time last semester and i was so worried about failing not just in school but as a person.,1
what helped me get through that is just focusing on right now and being the best person i can be right now.,1
"things will work out and your life is not going to be nearly as shitty as you expect, if you want to talk, id love too!",1
"sometimes, i feel worthless too.",1
"i really do, sometimes i feel like i have no talent and it fucking sucks.",1
whats something you like to do?,1
i agree with /u/walken_on_sunshine.,1

id love to talk if you want to!,1
"its really nice of you to do this, thank you.",1
"tell them that even tough things are hard right now, things really do get better.",1
tell them youll talk with them over private message if they want to talk about their problems.,1
"once again, the world needs more people like you :",1
you seem like a really nice person.,1
you say you have lived for 25 years with nothing to show for it?,1
"i disagree, you have accomplished a lot graduating college and you are an empathetic person who cares.",1
ive felt similarly to you--feeling like nothing will get better and whats the point anymore.,1
"for me, it just took time and working towards the things i wanted to accomplish regardless of how stupid it seemed--it helped me a lot.",1
"however, they may be needing help themselves.",1
"anyways, what can i do to help you?",1
"you should, im a 20 year old girl so maybe i can help you out a little :",1
"youre welcome, i know youll be okay :",1
this sounds really frustrating and scary.,1
"however, you are young and youre still creating yourself.",1
you may have hid behind the smart girl persona in the past but you are so much more than that.,1
dont let people tell you who you are.,1
be who you are and do what you love.,1
fuck what other people think as long as youre truly happy.,1
"im sorry, that sounds really difficult.",1
i dont know where youre from but in the us i know its hard to live on minimum wage especially part-time.,1
you must feel like an outsider in your own family and im truly sorry for that.,1
i think you need to tell your family how you feel.,1
"i can relate, i wasnt doing well in school last semester but i realized what i had to do and worked harder and my grades are okay now.",1
i know that a lot of people who are depression or bipolar can be suicidal but they are not institutionalized.,1
i dont know enough about that system.,1
"however, i think its worth it to talk to someone again.",1
im scared about the future too.,1
"however, what keeps me from freaking out is living in the moment.",1
i try to be the best person i can be today and enjoy living as much as possible.,1
"also, what ive learned that nothing is as worse as it seems like it will be.",1
so whenever i get scared and worried about the future i remind myself that and i also remind myself that its my life and i am in control and i can live my life the way i want to.,1
"i dont have to be like those miserable people, i dont want to be like them.",1
you already have an internship which is a great start to your future!,1
you should be excited about whats to come because youre going to have a good life even if you dont know where it will take you yet.,1
"if you want to talk, id love to!",1
youre trying your best and you need to keep trying.,1
"youre son needs his mother, leaving him would be the most selfish thing you will ever do and it will be the last thing you ever do.",1
you should at least try talking to your husband and maybe see about seeing a therapist.,1
things will get better and you will be so happy to see your son grown up!,1
"you have a lot to live for, life seems rough right now but the people that you love and who love you need you more than ever.",1
we all have rough patches in our life and we live through them and come out the other end better and stronger.,1
"children cant always have a  parent, its silly and unhealthy for the child.",1
"im only 20 and moved out of the house but im so thankful for my mom and dad who made home-cooked meals and checked my homework even though i didnt like it at the time, its helped me in the long run to become a responsible adult.",1
youre doing the best you can to support your son and yourself.,1
maybe try looking for a new job while still working--you never know what opportunities are out there if you dont try!,1
"im sorry to hear about your ex-husband, that must be really difficult.",1
"i wish you all the best and if youd like to talk, id love to!",1
i run out of toilet paper all the time too :,1
things are really difficult for you right now but things will get better soon.,1
you just have to hold on and stay as positive as possible even though its hard :,1
"im sorry, things sound rough right now.",1
you seem like a very strong person and with that attitude youll go far.,1
i think that you need to seek help.,1
since you go to a university they most likely have a counseling service that you should go to.,1
i really think that you need to find help and stop self medicating.,1
"id go to /r/bipolar or /r/bipolarreddit and maybe talk to them, also, /r/depression might be able to help!",1
college is hard and its a complicated and difficult time.,1
i feel like that too sometimes.,1
what helps me is living in the moment and enjoying life as it is right now.,1
robins death is very tragic and it obviously hit you hard.,1
you may just be in mourning right now but i am not you so i wouldnt know.,1
"if you want to talk about anything, im here :",1
"yes, and with a positive attitude like that, you will be golden :",1
im sorry to hear about your situation and im sorry about your mom.,1
is there a cure for your skin disease?,1
"everyone in the past who has ever lived, has died.",1
"however, just because we all die eventually doesnt mean our lives are meaningless.",1
all the people who have died before you have left a world of amazing things.,1
"not all are great, but a lot of those things that people have created have outlived their creator and changed lives.",1
i guess what im trying to say is yes we will all die and we cant help it but everyone has their time on earth to change things for the better.,1
"pm me if you want to talk, id love to because you sound like you have an interesting perspective :",1
"sometimes, the world seems really tough and the future is scary.",1
you just need to know that things will get better if you try to make them so and sometimes things just get better over time.,1
maybe you should just take off right now and travel and enjoy the world.,1
youll find something along the way that will bring hope and meaning to your life.,1
"i wish you the best and if you ever want to talk, im here :",1
i guess hope is kind of ridiculous because its just living for the future and believing that good will come some day.,1
"but i think that hope is important and obviously its the last thing to go, but the first thing to come back.",1
"if you can just find a glimmer of hope, i know that you can do this.",1
"youre right, things do get better.",1
youre young and going through a tough time right now with your self image/worth.,1
what has helped me is just to focus on things that make me truly happy.,1
i ate right and went on walks and i felt so much better.,1
"youre so young, things will get better :",1
i just wanted to know if there was anything i could do :,1
those memories that i have of the good times are really the great times.,1
"i think about them sometimes and i think,  it also helps to just appreciate the little things :",1
"this seems like a realllly shitty situation now, but trust me, it will be okay.",1
"ive known people whove cheated on their husbands, they had a kid, they got a divorce and now shes happy and in a new house with a new guy.",1
"im not trying to say cheating is a good thing, im just saying on the grand scale of things, its not the worst thing you can do.",1
you have to trust me that it will get better.,1
"you seem like an awesome person, whos just had a rough time.",1
its not worth it to kill yourself.,1
"sometimes i think life is going to get better and it doesnt, but then when i least expect it, things take a turn for the best and thats just how life is.",1
"you have to change the things you can, and accept the things you cant.",1
"if you want to talk, im here :",1
"im sorry that youre feeling this way, what can i do to help?",1
"you are young, things will turn up.",1
"i think you can do it, i know its cheesy but this is one of my favorite quotes,  i dont know who said it but its comforting in a way.",1
"im really glad i could help you, and thank you for the kind words :",1
"if you ever need to talk, im here to listen and offer advice if you like!",1
you say you want a job so i think you should get out there and get some applications and just start from there.,1
"seriously, just go to a store, fill out an application and turn it in.",1
its the first step and once you get the ball rolling i think it will help to do it again.,1
i really think you just need to take the first step.,1
"i know that you may not believe this but youll meet someone else, you will.",1
when i was 18  i thought i met the love of my life and i could not see myself with anyone else.,1
"however, he ended things and i thought i would never love again.",1
i still havent found someone special but thats okay with me because i know its coming.,1
i believe in my future and ive worked really hard to get to that point.,1
"im sorry, that sounds fucking stressful and scary.",1
but everything will be alright.,1
things might get worse before they get better but they will get better.,1
you are actively trying not to pain peoples feelings which is more than a lot of people do.,1
you seem like a good person you just need to stop beating yourself up.,1
"its good that you try not to pain peoples feelings, however youre not responsible for how people understand what you say or do.",1
i think you should seek help because you seem like a really nice guy and you care about other people--we need more people like you!,1
"id love to get to know you more, pm me if you want to talk!",1
i dont think death is such a bad thing but it limits your life.,1
you wont be anything that you were going to be.,1
"i dont know that death is such a bad thing for the person that it happens to, i dont know that for a fact.",1
but do you it for a fact that death is a good thing for a person?,1
"youre right, it is selfish for a person to not want you to die.",1
but its a good thing to know that there are people who dont want you to die and who maybe depend on you and love you more than you think.,1
"aww, darling, you seem like an amazing person with a bright future.",1
i am 20 and in college  and sometimes i feel like ill never be successful too but i look back on my life and think of all the things i didnt think id be able to do and i realized that i am here and i did them.,1
you should talk to a counselor at your school about your problems and maybe they can help you!,1
"you honestly have so much to offer and if you can get through this, youll be a stronger young woman who will be able to help people and make a lot of peoples lives better--including yours!",1
i honestly would love to get to know you and talk to you if you want to!,1
you seem like an amazing person!,1
you really should not be thinking this way about yourself.,1
"no matter what you look like, i dont care if you are the ugliest mother fucker who has ever graced this planet you are still beautiful if you have a beautiful personality.",1
and i am guaranteed that you are not that ugly.,1
you always are youre own harshest critic.,1
beauty is only on the outside and it has nothing to do with your inner qualities.,1
"no matter how  you look, you will never be ugly enough to be deserving to die, no one is.",1
you should talk to your therapist about these things.,1
why do you feel like you cant talk to them?,1
"youre so young and it is really difficult to your life will take you, but if you work towards what you want in the future it will happen :",1
im sorry youre feeling this way.,1
could you elaborate on why you cant live like .,1
id really like to help if i can :,1
"i understand, everyone always thinks of me as the  and i feel like i cant talk to anyone because a i dont think they would take me seriously and b i dont want to ruin peoples views of me.",1
sometimes pretending to be happy helps me become actually happy it just sucks that i feel like id be ruining my image and im embarrassed/ashamed of the way i feel sometimes.,1
she woudnt have offered you the option of doing it privately if she didnt want to so i think you should do it!,1
"also, i doubt that other people notice your voice disorder as much as you think :",1
what youre going through sucks.,1
im not exactly sure what you need to hear but pm me and we can talk!,1
"yeah, what you did was a shit thing to do.",1
you know it was a shit thing to do and that was a decision that you made when you were younger.,1
doing shitty things is just as much a decision as doing good things.,1
ive done things in the past that i regret but its put me in a place where i can look back and say how dumb i was and how i will never do that again and hopefully educate others to never do the things that i do.,1
"all in all, my mistakes have made me a better person and youre mistakes will make you a better person if you let them.",1
id love to talk to you about anything!,1
"if you want to talk, id love too.",1

it feels much better on the other side of finals.,1
i dont mean to make your stresses seem small but it feels much better on the other side.,1
do you enjoy being a math major?,1
sometimes i dont think that being positive is self delusion as well but then i remember that perspective is everything.,1
if something is shitty you can look at it in a different way.,1
"for example, you lose your job, you gain new opportunities and you get to expand your life.",1
"i really hope youre okay, and please, if you want to talk you can talk to me!",1
"im really sorry, i dont know what youre feeling but i can understand it.",1
i have a money spending problem and i didnt do well last semester in college either and im worried about wasting my parents money and then they wont be able to pay for my sister especially if i have to go to college for a 5th year due to my bad grades.,1

"a quote that i read today was,  if youd like to talk id love too!",1
im not too far from 18 so i might be able to relate :,1
im really sorry that theres no cure.,1
not to minimize your situation but i guess there are just things in our life that we cant change and we have to learn to accept it and change ourselves.,1

"i understand how you feel, i feel similar too sometimes.",1
im really glad youre feeling better today!,1
you have the possibility to change things.,1
"if youre willing to take your own life, a big decision and a final one, then why cant you quit your job and move somewhere else?",1
"something not nearly as final, however it is a big decision.",1
"instead of ending your life, why dont you try and change it, even if it something little.",1
maybe go to a bar tonight and say hi to at least one person.,1
you have the opportunity to change your life and live.,1
"you seem to have a way with words, im jealous.",1
"anyways, i just would like to know why youre posting here.",1
i feel like if you really wanted to kill yourself you wouldnt post here.,1
"the nights are hard for me too, thats why i go on reddit, tumblr, watch a movie, read a book, maybe some tv.",1
you just have to keep yourself busy until youre so tired and then fall asleep.,1
"youre welcome, im happy to help and if you want to talk im always here :",1
this is the attitude i have everyday and it takes work but youll be much happier.,1

the most important thing is that youre trying.,1
thats fucking awesome and good for you!,1
"a couple months ago, i felt really down about school and i was missing classes too.",1
the way school is set up is really fucking stupid but i realized its something that will make my life better in the long run .,1
"how i got back into the swing of things was to just focus on living life now, because thats all we have.",1
we have to enjoy our life as it is now and not worry about the future because thats not guaranteed.,1
ive been so much happier after i started focusing on the moment.,1
"youre right, people are ignorant, but not everyone.",1
"and i think that even if someone else cant see what is beautiful, it doesnt matter.",1
"if you want to talk, id love to, you seem like an interesting and insightful person.",1
things would not be easier for your parents if you were gone.,1
im really sorry that youre feeling this way.,1

i think that it may be worth it to consider taking antidepressants.,1
"i dont know enough about them to recommend them, and its obviously your choice whether you take them or not but if you dont think you can make it 6 months it might be a good idea.",1
you cant leave your family behind and i know youd regret it if you did.,1
i feel similar to that too sometimes.,1
sometimes i think ill never have a good job and ill never make money because i feel like i have no skills.,1
"however, every job that ive been at i was so afraid to start because i felt as though i knew nothing and i was incapable but i learned how to do the job and i gained new skills through the job.",1
i lack motivation too a lot of the time and sometimes im lucky enough that the motivation just comes to me.,1
"however, the motivation doesnt always just come to me.",1
what i do to spark motivation is surround myself with potential motivators like knowing i want to go out on the weekend so i do my homework during the week because im motivated not to do it on the weekend when i want to spend time with friends.,1
you have to make up your own motivation.,1
"for example, i woke up today and my house was really messy and i want it clean, but i realllly dont want to clean it but i know a clean house will be worth all the effort i put into it in the end.",1
"you just have to give it a little time, dont doubt yourself because youre much stronger than you think and surround yourself with things that motivate you.",1
you have to work at your life to make it better.,1
"sometimes, good things happen but even better things happen when you go out and do something about it.",1
you need to talk to someone at your school and explain your situation to see if someone can help you with your classes and possibly even with other things :,1
"if you want to talk, im here :",1
"if you want to talk about stuff, im here to listen!",1
why are you calling yourselves those words?,1
"hey, you are young, things will change and opportunities will come.",1
"if you want your life to change, you have to do something about it and youre speculating about your future which hasnt even come yet and it can be sooooo much better than you think it will.",1
"ive felt like killing myself at times and then something happens and i think,",1
im sorry youre feeling that way and i understand why.,1
i think i might feel similar to you sometimes too.,1
but what i do is just accept the things that i cant change--i cant change other people i just have to let them live.,1
"however, you can be the change you want to see.",1
live your life with love and hope and youll be happier.,1
"not everything is terrible and im starting to realize that, its all about state of mind.",1
you seem to have had an interesting life and its not over.,1
you can pull yourself out of what youre in now.,1
"things will get better you just have to make it though this dark time and youll be okay, i promise.",1
please message me if you want to talk!,1
be strong and never lose hope.,1
"dont do it, its really not worth it as you can seriously pain yourself and flatulence/wind up having things worse than before.",1
"if youd like to talk, i am here and id love to :",1
thank you so much for posting.,1
im so thankful that you are here to show others that things to get better if you work for it!,1
i obviously dont know you but i am truly proud that you made your life better and are still trying!,1
"damn, college can be rough as fuck.",1
i was at risk for failing out last semester and it was mainly because i was in the wrong major for me.,1
i was doing what other people told me to do and i switched majors and im doing really well now and im so much happier.,1
switching majors to something you enjoy might help you tons!,1
and you do have a future ahead of you.,1
life is hard and sometimes things are so shitty that you dont see a good future.,1
"but trust me, things will get better and youll have an awesome life if you work for it.",1
i was in a similar situation to you last semester and it sucks but you find a way to work though it.,1
"if i were you, id go see your schools therapist again because not being able to concentrate is not good, especially in college.",1
they may be able to prescribe you with something that can help with your attention span.,1
"anyways, i hope things get better for you and if you want to talk im here :",1
"things will get better, it will take a little time but eventually they will and if you can hold on youll be stronger and youll be glad youre alive.",1
"sounds like your other half really wants to be part of your life, no one is beyond saving but you have to help yourself, which means you need to talk to a medical professional.",1
just cause you push people away doesnt mean they wont come back.,1
but by the sounds of it the first step is addressing what is going on with you.,1
i was just tossing the possibility out there.,1
"if it is the case, i am surprised your doctors havent looked into different studies because that is you know a pretty rare thing to become immune that fast.",1
"if you fail, the honest truth, you will end up in a hospital on lockdown, and things with basically not longer be your decision.",1
"so the easiest solution to that is get help, and talk to people while the ball is in your court.",1
"as the poster below states exactly your gonna end up with a damaged body, and on lockdown, and shit will be a hell of a lot worse then the reason you decided suicide was worth in the first place.",1
"have you consulted other medical professionals, is there nothing no one can do, medical science is pretty amazing.",1
"you have ever right to be angry, however by the sounds of it is not that doctors fault, you simply suffered likely one of the known complications and side effects, even if its rare.",1
"you cant blame another human being and effect their job and life, because you got fucked over by statistics combined with your genes.",1
"that being said, start talking to other docs, gather information, plenty of people become impotent at young ages for all kinds of reasons.",1
might help to find and talk to people in the same boat as you.,1
"resources arent family, they are things like groups for victims of sexual assault, who are capable of hooking you up with a network of people to talk to, therapy, mental health, pretty much a host of things under the sun.",1
family and friends are support systems but they arent in a position to truly help you.,1
"other groups are, unfortunately your story is not unique and plenty of people have unfortunately gone through what you have.",1
"nothing like that is treatable, treatment by all means does not make things disappear.",1
and therapy and support groups might be one of those things you always have to go do.,1
mental health treatment isnt magic you have to help yourself as well.,1
"it only wins if you let it, sometimes depression is like ivy, its hard to kill but its manageable if you keeping cutting it back.",1
meds might not of helped you cause they werent the right meds.,1
"talking to someone, combines with meds, other resources, and learning new coping skills might make a world of difference.",1
"and for the record fuck the people you go to school with, chances are you will never interact with those people again.",1
"no such thing as normal, everyone has flaws, demons, etc.",1
"talk to your friends, let them know that you support them in whats going on with your life etc, and they dont have to hide it from you that you are willing to listen etc.",1
"lockdown in the hospital its meds in a controlled environment etc, therapy all that good stuff.",1
"you have misread the law in aus, i just googled it and said that if you make a suicide pact with someone and you fail and the other person dies then you can be charged with manslaughter, or manslaughter in regards to assisted suicide not in regards to just failing offing yourself.",1
im fine with whatever you want to use.,1
"first never apologize for venting, we all need to vent.",1
"look at this way, suicide and thoughts as such are not an easy thing to deal with, and no matter what life brings you in the future good or bad, remember that you are stronger than you think.",1
sometimes it really just all is relative so to speak.,1
"and if you ever want to talk, or anything i can help with inbox is open.",1
#NAME?,1
#NAME?,1
fuck what others tell you sex is or what it should be about.,1
#NAME?,1
#NAME?,1
"change is possible, if you want it bad enough.",1
#NAME?,1
#NAME?,1
"there are tons of meds on the market there is a combo that works for you, but you have to work with the doc to find that combo, which includes possible lifestyle changes etc.",1
#NAME?,1
#NAME?,1
even pills can do a lot of damage and pain before they kill you.,1
"thats if they kill you, most people pass out and vomiting in their sleep.",1
op the fact that you wrote this is a cry for help.,1
it shows that you dont actually want to do what you are talking about doing.,1
"talk to someone, your life is fixable, there are lots of resources and things for people that have gone through what you have.",1
"911, safe than sorry and it will put your friend on the radar to get the help he needs, so he doesnt do it again.",1
hopefully they can figure out something.,1
"thing will get better, college can happen at any age it doesnt have to happen now.",1
"my suggestion is give it some more time, check out some more resources, sometimes when things are done in a pinch they dont work as well.",1
"can you go to a college that is local, so you can live at home, work, get financial aid and go to school?",1
"my other advice to you is if these people were truly your friends they wouldnt just not communicate with you, in truth most people dont keep their high school friends through out life.",1
i will ask this and i apologize if it doesnt work.,1
are you immune to drugs or is it a mental thing?,1
are you messing with yourself so to speak?,1
"ie if you believe the drugs wont work, they wont.",1
often with depression drugs alone dont do the trick.,1
yeah well maybe that is not a bad thing.,1
"buddy sounds like he could use some intervention, and even when people think their parents are going to react badly often they do not, they are just happy their kid is not dead.",1
college isnt for everyone but there might be a trade etc that is right up your alley.,1
if you are having issues talk to a health professional as well they can hook you up with resources that are free that can help with coping methods etc.,1
"your 17, you dont know what living is yet.",1
that sounds horrible and harsh but its true.,1
"talk to your parents, friends, someone you trust, get yourself help.",1
"put it this way, if you tried 23 times and failed there is a reason.",1
"if it was something you really wanted to do, you wouldnt have posted this, and you wouldnt have had 23 almost check outs.",1
"youve been through some awful shit there is no denying that, and i am not trying to negate that.",1
"but living and thriving after something like that is possible, and you are not alone in your experiences or what you are feeling.",1
prude bitch called 911 to treat a fucking bruise?,1
"im no lawyer, but i would assume a serious assault charge would require a professional and unbiased medical examination.",1
"it sounds like her ego took the biggest blow that evening, if anything .",1
youre awesome for showing her that you wont take any shit from people who try to treat you like a doormat.,1
id be surprised if they even showed up.,1
"my mom got a court summons by some dickhead police officers, who  her while she was in a state of hysteria following a serious 5-car accident caused by heavy rain that almost killed us.",1
she couldnt even form fucking sentences and the cop cited her for driving recklessly or some bullshit based on her incoherent babbling.,1
"court summons arrived in the mail later that month, all the days up to the court date i thought my mom was going to break down at any moment.",1
pm me anytime you have a question or need to splooge your thoughts somewhere.,1
doesnt matter if i have no idea who you are.,1
thank you for sharing i hope everything goes well for you and best of luck finding a stable career!,1
hey theres a reason you have heard the  because it seems to be the safest option alternatively you can contact child protection services or someone at your school like a principal or guidance counsellor.,1
you have two other siblings do the right thing if you fear your safety then this might not be the best option but its all you got its one shot killing yourself will just end everything i dont know if you believe in afterlife but i would bet my chips on it.,1
even if you dont decide to talk about your parents please please please see a counsellor its important that you receive the support you need if you have any questions pm me,1
please seek help i know its cliche but we all need our support system and with your mother gone you need to build a new support system and seeking help can really solve that problem,1
"you know, that does sound appealing.",1
you want this because you are dissatisfied with something.,1
"it would provide the ultimate opportunity to rest, for people to me and you.",1
death is the room at which all is black and your thoughts are forever frozen.,1
"i often go for walks, or skis.",1
"im just another being on this humble plane, but id like to offer what advise i might have, so here goes.",1
it may not get better at school.,1
school is not the only place there is.,1
dont give up after trying one path; there are more and they are more different than you would believe.,1
life could probably get a lot better in your next stop; i bet youd be seriously motivated to succeed if you changed paths.,1
"death is of course not what you really, really want.",1
"how about this, there are people on reddit who would talk to you every day.",1
do you think that might help support you?,1
i want you to be free from the suffering.,1
i know a way to free yourself from external factors.,1
a way to gain happiness within.,1
im not talking about some esoteric bullshit.,1
im talking about transforming your mind.,1
just pm me and ill tell you more.,1
your worth in society for example.,1
its so fucked up what we were told.,1
people kill themselves because they think they are not worth it.,1
there is no fucking reason to be alive.,1
dont be pressured into believing you have to be  it.,1
some arbitrary standard i have to life up to?,1
dont look at what other people have or can do.,1
just look at yourself and what person you are.,1
"and to be honest, you seem like a decent guy!",1
you feel like you have been selfish in the past?,1
"ok, just try to have better intentions next time.",1
you should try to love yourself.,1
"see, maybe you fucked everything up  but you did it with the intention of being a good person.",1
"we have little control over what happens with us in our lifes , but we shouldnt blame ourselves.",1
"for example, you are trying to get a job.",1
its not that you are too lazy or just cant be asked.,1
you should love youself for that!,1
you do care about your children.,1
you should care about yourself because you are a good person.,1
its just that shit happened to you that was  out of your control.,1
please get rid of that part in your thinking that says you dont deserve things or that you are not worth it.,1
unfortunately this is just conditioning.,1
"we are told from young age how to be and what it means to be worthy of living in society, etc.",1
"it takes some time, even years.",1
and analyze the way you think.,1
why do we all think we have to achieve something special?,1
its the same reason we want to have kids.,1
once you realize that your head is basically fucking with you its easier to just let these thoughts be and to not act upon them.,1
"dont get me wrong, theres nothing wrong with trying to achieve something for yourself, but if it doesnt work out you shouldnt worry about it.",1
we all suffered from conditioning throughout our lifes.,1
thats why we think we are not  or why we seek happiness in the wrong places.,1
try to not look at what others have.,1
instead try to look inside yourself and see what little thing can make you happy.,1
i meditate and have to say that things are getting more and more clear for me.,1
we have a lot of baggage in our lifes.,1
meditation helps me to  this baggage.,1
"hell, it lets me laugh about it.",1
its like you see your mind telling yourself  but you know its just conditioning of your mind.,1
pm me if you want to talk or if you want any more details about meditation.,1
"first of all i want to say, i want you to live!",1
"well, you might say that i dont know you and you would be right.",1
first of all i would recommend getting professional help.,1
not the first person that is available but someone who you feel comfortable talking with.,1
someone nice that can help you out.,1
try some jobs involving cannabis.,1
"you got arrested for possesion, but people working in this industry  wouldnt mind hiring you.",1
"thirdly, get away from that crazy bitch.",1
you cannot help your children right now.,1
you have to sort out your life first.,1
crazy as she is she will make stupid mistakes and the kids will be given to you when your life is sorted out.,1
and even if that is not going to happen.,1
once your kids are old enough they want to get to know you and they will realize what a nice guy you are and what a bitch she is.,1
you could try out meditation btw.,1
i helped me hugely during times of anxiety and depression.,1
talk about it with your professional help or pm me if you want to know details about it.,1
i hope this post will help you out in any way!,1
next time i meditate i will think about you.,1
some guy from germany who cares!,1
and why do you need a decent job?,1
why not pick up trash for example?,1
just because someone defined wastemen to be not a decent living?,1
its not about having a great job.,1
just get a job where you can help people or the community.,1
you tried to be something to prove to other people that they are wrong.,1
find something you want to be.,1
"you might still be a loser in the eyes of most people, but you know what.",1
you have to feel good about yourself.,1
the universe doesnt care if you achieve something or not.,1
your perspective on life is defined by the things you have been told and by the way you think.,1
\xe2\x80\x9cwe are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think.,1
"when the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.",1
"\xe2\x80\x9dand\xe2\x80\x9cyou yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.",1
\xe2\x80\x9dim pretty sure meditation might do you good.,1
i have done it for several years.,1
this exploring might help you find out what it is you need to be happy .,1
because they are all conditioned into believing in a fairytale about happiness.,1
so that another kid that sees you will see that there are people who are different.,1
you said you meditated before.,1
what kind of meditation and for how long?,1
"you have been made to believe in certain facts, like:",1
#NAME?,1
#NAME?,1
its been feed to you since you were a small child.,1
you should check with a doctor.,1
that can be a serious problem and might influence the way you think and act.,1
just get any job and smoke in the evenings.,1
and did you do metta  meditation towards yourself?,1
you get around and go to new places.,1
it all depends on your attitude.,1
go and get yourself some hobbies.,1
good way to get to know people and to get to know girls .,1
well im truly saddened by this.,1
its people like you that make me truly happy you existed but saddened you must go.,1
"i know i speak for most, if not all, the redditors here when i say; tell me why you are feeling this way.",1
we can do our best to help in any way.,1
im sad to hear someone else had to go through this pain.,1
and glad at the same time to share it with someone else.,1
and i truly dont want to be alone either.,1
i dont want to be here missing the one person who was the only thing i had in the world.,1
i dont know what else is left for me to care about.,1
"and that is what hurts the most, i just dont know what to do and dont care to do anything.",1
im sorry for your troubles my friend :,1
i hope you find someone or maybe you find a way to is your troubles with the one you love.,1
i wish i could save people from what i am going through.,1
"better than doing nothing, get someone to show him that he is cared for.",1
if you get a chance you could go personally and help him.,1
try to cheer him up and distract him from these thoughts.,1
"if you need a friend, ill be there for you.",1
you are a blessing to this world.,1
your family will feel very sad.,1
"btw, its better you try taking that anti-depressing medication.",1
everyone has a guardian angel.,1
there are so many alternative treatments you could try.,1
people recover from  cancers all the time.,1
try the alternative treatments.,1
have you got a history of depression?,1
is this the first time youve thought about killing yourself?,1
have you spoken to a therapist about this?,1
"its going to take time, but their is still so much worth living for.",1
"there are people youve never met yet, and adventures still to be had.",1
"im not saying they will find a magical cure, but medicine may be found to make this all more bearable.",1
suicide is just never worth it.,1
care to elaborate on how youve screwed up?,1
"youre only human, so inherently youre not perfect.",1
"these fuck-ups in life make us more wise in the future, its not worth giving up on yourself just yet.",1
im struggling to think of anything useful to say right now.,1
you could be feeling like youre taking control of the situation.,1
youre doing something about how youre feeling.,1
"for me, finding some things to substitute actually committing suicide has helped regain some of that sense of relief.",1
"im not sure how healthy it is, but writing out my plan, writing out the pros and cons of suicide, writing out a note, without the full intention of suicide, has helped in the past.",1
"i cant say it will or wont be fleeting, everyone is different.",1
try to remember that youre a living person and that you deserve to feel in control and at peace.,1
please consider going to a hospital.,1
"its not quite the same, but that in itself is a way to exert control over the situation.",1
would it be possible for you to visit a food bank until your next disability payment?,1
consider talking to your therapist about making small payments on top of your regular payments to cover the payment youll be missing .,1
just get rid of whatever you smoked it with and consider it a mistake that youre handling.,1
you were hurting and you did something to dull the pain.,1
"if you need to spend time in the hospital, think about telling them youre suicidal without swallowing the tylenol.",1
i hope tonight passes and you feel better soon.,1
youre not wasting anyones time.,1
"youre in a lot of pain, its natural to want to end your pain.",1
it might feel like your whole sense of self was tied up in her and now it might feel tied up in her absence.,1
"it probably feels awful to be that person right now and i cant tell you for sure, but it might not always be that way.",1
i know that  and  can pale in comparison to the desire to end things right now.,1
"suicide is, for the most part, a sure end and continuing on because things might get better seems the poor alternative.",1
"however, being suicidal is like having a film over your eyes, anything you look at right now is probably colored by how badly you feel.",1
"from my perspective outside of that film, with what information youve provided, i can tell you that suicide isnt the only way through this.",1
"you may be able to heal from this, you may be able to come to terms with yourself and live for yourself.",1
"youre not a relationship, youre your own person.",1
"guilt, shame, and feeling hopeless are pretty powerful motivators.",1
"i know that in my own life, theyve been extremely powerful motivators towards suicide.",1
"i imagine you feel a lot of responsibility for having aids, for your lover having aids, and for whatever affect it might have on your family.",1
i dont think feeling responsibility or guilt or shame or whatever means you need to die.,1
i apologize if this isnt what you meant.,1
"i also think it means that you care very deeply about what has happened, what is happening and you want it to end.",1
death isnt the only way to handle this.,1
"please consider going to an emergency room, talking to someone about this, anything.",1
i know you dont want to experience this anymore but think about exhaustion some other options before suicide.,1
"i cant guarantee that things will work out but you deserve, no matter what has happened in your life, a chance to have help with this situation.",1
it sounds to me like youre very much depression.,1
"the lack of interest, the absence of pleasure in things you enjoyed, the general indecisive malaise.",1
i guess what i want to say is that i know it sucks and it feels like life sucks  but it could get better.,1
"maybe not better in the sense that everything works out and you feel good most of the time, but better in the sense of finding pleasant islands in the ocean.",1
youre in between islands again right now but theres another one out there.,1
"i dont know if that makes continuing to live worth it, but you can only find out if you do continue to live.",1
"i hope this doesnt come off as dismissive, its something that i tell myself sometimes and im still here.",1
i also want to say that at times ive gone through something similar.,1
"i personally find that since we live in a seemingly immeasurable universe, our importance in it is also immeasurable.",1
it just has ceased to mean much to me.,1
im not quite sure why or how that came about.,1
"i dont think i have a view on whether or not a person should or should not commit suicide over a philosophical view, in general.",1
i was a hitter for a long time.,1
"i think the best thing right now, would be to stop drinking for the day/night.",1
it helps at first but it can make you feel this much more deeply.,1
"if you havent, try talking about these feelings with your friends.",1
"if theres someone you really trust, talk about the self harm if you can.",1
"if not, keep talking about it online.",1
"while i cant say its impossible for someone to drug something, please consider the amount of time and effort a doctor would have to put in to spike your food.",1
"please also consider that even though the attention you received was uncomfortable, it was likely  out of concern.",1
its very difficult to truly force anyone to take medications in a consistent enough way for those medications to have real effect.,1
"if youre ever comfortable enough, i urge you to speak to the doctor again, even about your concerns about he or she drugging you.",1
"they may also be able to provide some insight into some of the personal issues you expressed in your diary entry, possibly in the form of talk therapy.",1
"i dont mean this as a way of passing you off, but  might be something to try.",1
i know how hard it is to go to people for help and have it go nowhere or have it set things back.,1
youve got a lot of stress coming at you.,1
posting about this is proactive.,1
talking about all of these issues is a strong thing to do.,1
i imagine its really difficult to ask for help when it feels like there are things out to get you.,1
"i know its part of why i find it difficult, its hard to trust in those circumstances.",1
it doesnt take much to damage our ability to trust and it sounds like youve had some really bad experiences.,1
please think about going to someone with these issues.,1
"doctors, therapists, hotlines, groups online, counselors if youre in school, anything.",1
i hear you about the financial concerns and i think its a really valid concern.,1
"like you said, thats not very good for suicidal thoughts.",1
"many hospitals do offer charity assistance if it comes down to that being your only alternative at some point, however.",1
i hope you find something and i hope you can feel better.,1
"when i was younger, violent thoughts, i think, were my way of feeling control.",1
i dont mean to say thats why youre having them.,1
it was tough for me to separate what i was thinking from who i am.,1
"im not sure if youve heard all of this stuff before, but instead of push pins, have you ever tried holding ice or something similar?",1
it doesnt always get better and it doesnt always take time.,1
theres just the chance for that.,1
i wish i could offer you something more practical but i just dont have those experiences to offer.,1
i just wanted to say that ive felt the same way so often.,1
i hope you can find something in your life to make you feel like living.,1
im sorry i dont have any helpful suggestions.,1
it sounds like youre taking a lot of good steps.,1
its hard to look back at how things used to be.,1
i often feel the same way about people ive left behind.,1
"regardless of how your birthday goes, think of it as a milestone.",1
"you can look back at this birthday and say,  i hope that you get all the help you need and can have the life you want.",1
ive been somewhere close to there with depression people and ive experienced deep depression many times myself.,1
sometimes im too close to a person or a problem to separate myself from it and see the issue as it really is.,1
in my own life ive tried not to focus so much on how i feel about what a person is experiencing but more on how that person might feel about it.,1
"it helps some, when i can remember to do so.",1
how much do you choose to be happy?,1
not to take away from the appreciation you have for your life but try to choose to be unhappy for a week.,1
could you do it for the whole week?,1
try imagining your partner doing the same about happiness.,1
"situational depression is real, of course.",1
"some people fall into a depression from grief, from stress, from dissatisfaction.",1
chronic depression often seems like theres no reason.,1
ive had great circumstances in my own life and couldnt understand myself why i felt nothing but a desire to stop existing.,1
"being worn down by someone elses depression is understandable and pretty common, just like any chronic illness.",1
"reaching out like youre doing now can be really helpful, not only for understanding your partner better, but for getting some support for how youre feeling too.",1
telling ourselves  were just being lazy seems to me to be a pretty common reaction to feeling poorly.,1
im not sure i can really offer any practical advice other than to communicate with the people in your life about these issues.,1
it can be tough to struggle through alone.,1
im not sure anyone can tell you why its worth it outside of why its worth it personally.,1
its worth it  for me because there are sometimes things that i enjoy.,1
sometimes it feels not at all worth it.,1
"i dont think i can articulate why i dont kill myself during those times, im not usually sure.",1
i wish i could give you a definitive answer.,1
i just wanted to throw in holding ice as a substitute for cutting or any immediate self harming.,1
its tough for me to argue with a pros and cons list.,1
i think its important to consider how much that emotional upset pain influences our perception of pros and cons.,1
"i think if i wrote one today, right now, the cons would remain constant but the pros would be much smaller.",1
"i also think about suicide a lot, it often seems like the natural answer to anything.",1
"im guessing you stopped your medication for a reason, but i want to urge you to try them again.",1
not feeling anymore is tempting and im not sure i can really argue against the merits of that.,1
"i can say, however, that i personally find the potential for feeling better to be worth remaining for.",1
"regardless, i hope you can find peace soon.",1
"its just been my experience, the downs and the sort of ups.",1
"i struggle with saying it to other people sometimes, because i dont know what other peoples experiences are.",1
"sometimes i think it helps, sometimes im not sure that i didnt make it worse for someone.",1
everything feels like a gamble with someones life and with how someone feels.,1
i wish i could say something helpful.,1
i dont think youre crazy for being angry a lot.,1
i think thats a pretty expected response to your life.,1
i know that it was my go to response for a long time .,1
"i cant say i had the same experiences you had, ive never dealt with much bullying, but the anxiety before school , the retreat into internet and fantasy, those really ring a bell with me.",1
"i have a lot of trouble maintaining connections, ive never found it easy to be a good friend, or keep close connections.",1
"feeling like an outsider, not having the avenues available that a truly social person might have, is difficult.",1
i dont think its an end to things things though.,1
have you ever had any inpatient treatment?,1
both times i had a series of ect it was decided upon and delivered while i was inpatient on a mental health floor at a hospital.,1
"if youre on the verge of suicide, finding a safe place to help you with these decisions can be a help in itself.",1
"there is, of course, out patient ect.",1
"you really  just need to ask a psychiatrist, if youre seeing one.",1
"if youre not currently seeing someone, getting a referral from a general practitioner might be an avenue to go down .",1
i know how frustrating it is to seek help and find dead ends.,1
i wish i could offer something helpful about your marriage and your family.,1
"i dont think i can, i really think thats outside of my purview.",1
"not because i havent experienced family and relationships, but maybe because i havent experienced your relationship and family, if that makes sense.",1
"that said, im not sure what i said in my last response about concentrating on your own health and worrying about your situation later was the correct thing to say.",1
im not sure it wasnt either but i think you really need someone to hear you about your wife and your family.,1
i just wanted to let you know that im reading these things even if i dont really know what to respond to them with.,1
i do think you should keep talking about it.,1
"whether it is here, other subreddits, hotlines, message boards, anything or all of those things.",1
"you can also message the moderators here , ive done that before and spoken to people in private.",1
i wont tell you not to give up because i dont think its so simple that it can be boiled down to such a statement.,1
"youre fighting right now though, just by making that first post here.",1
"quick edit - i also dont mean to say that im passing you off, please do keep talking here if you feel inclined.",1
"id add that you might remember to get something to eat, to drink some water, sleep when you need to.",1
its okay to keep yourself safe during this.,1
"youre welcome, i hope you feel better.",1
i dont know if this applies to other people.,1
something i learned from my own personal life is that i cant make myself care.,1
"as harsh as it sounds, i absolutely do not care about other people, things, or life if my primary needs are not met.",1
"food, shelter, and positive attention .",1
i had to have help to get all of those things.,1
"i wasnt able to do it on my own, as much as i told myself that i should have been able to.",1
my help started with medical care.,1
i dont know what help youve had thus far.,1
"please, if you havent, see some doctors.",1
"if you have, see different ones.",1
"even if you have no way to pay for it, start small, find a free clinic, find somewhere with a sliding scale, find a learning hospital.",1
that is a lot of pressure hanging over you for a fairly long time.,1
"regardless of what possible effect this could have on what you want to do in the future, try to forgive yourself.",1
that is easier said than done but you dont deserve the torture this is putting you through.,1
nothing happens you cant work for steam you lose your steam accountsomething like that.,1
"no action needed you could work for a mobile game distributor/developer games can be replaced, over timeas much as it feels like the end of things if some of the outcomes you fear could come true, its not.",1
it would pain  but there are other alternatives.,1
"this isnt something to solve what youre going through, but its an example of something to help you begin to deal with it.",1
"please think about talking about this with someone, as many people as you feel comfortable doing so with.",1
"if you have access, talk to someone in a therapy capacity.",1
the anxiety and misery you feel about this are difficult to cope with.,1
"honestly, it makes a lot of sense.",1
thats why i think you should reconsider talking to someone.,1
"you do have to trust yourself, but i can see my own reasons for not returning to care in what you said and that is what makes me think you should try it anyway.",1
"it may be me projecting myself onto you, but i know that my own logic and reason cant always be trusted, from experience.",1
"things like depression are especially insidious because they speak to us, in a sense, through reason.",1
i dont seek a doctor again because ive tried multiple times and have had a few bad experiences.,1
i feel that i know the risk isnt worth it.,1
i havent actually seen more than a few doctors out of the many in my area.,1
ive only ever used one psychiatric hospital ward.,1
all of my experience is based on a tiny slice of psychiatry.,1
"what i mean to say is, i understand that youve decided to trust in yourself, but any doubt, i think, is reason enough to reach out.",1
"i cant sit here and tell you must see someone, especially when i am choosing not to .",1
"i dont mean to pressure you on this account , but i wouldnt want to see you not exhaust another option.",1
im absolutely sure you feel like theres no coming back right now.,1
you might not feel that way in a week or in a month or next year.,1
i am sorry you were violated again and that you have to go through this on top of whatever else is happening in your life.,1
in my own life there have been times where ive felt genuinely well regarded or well liked but i dont ever really feel part of that community.,1
theres a separateness there that i dont fully understand.,1
"i have learned, over time, that my self worth doesnt have to be so tied up in other people.",1
"that doesnt always, however, make it feel any better to be on the other side of the wall, so to speak.",1
"full disclosure though, i do and almost always have been able to maintain one close relationship at a time, i cant say ive ever truly been friendless so i can only imagine what that is really like.",1
i personally dont think there is a point.,1
most of the time im okay with that.,1
sometimes i think about how short a human lifetime is and it does feel like there isnt much difference between dying now and dying later.,1
"however, and this could be because i am a bit focused upon myself in general, i find myself living for good experiences.",1
"i dont really mean the grand experiences people talk about; the epic trips to strange places, the epiphanies, and so on.",1
doing things i genuinely like.,1
"of course, when people are depression, it can be really difficult to really enjoy things.",1
i think it would be disingenuous if i declared that this is something that should or would work in your own life.,1
"my overall point is that there are other things that some people do live for, not just the mainstream ideals that we grow up thinking we need to strive for.",1
i cant say if you will find your own point to life.,1
i do hope you can feel better.,1
i hope your next therapist is a better fit or results in some kind of relief.,1
i think your concern is founded but i dont think you should carry guilt for this.,1
i looked through some of your history.,1
would you consider telling your doctor that you feel suicidal?,1
youre in a lot of immediate pain right now but it looks like youve made it through some pretty difficult times before.,1
remember that some of the pain will pass.,1
not fitting some sexual norms doesnt make you a freak.,1
youre attracted to your sister and thats that.,1
"i cant comment on what that means because its a little out of my depth, to be honest, and i also think its up to you and your sister to define what that means.",1
"its okay if they dont work for you, many things didnt work for me.",1
some things were more like stepping stones for me.,1
"if things have been spiraling downwards, they can spiral upwards again too.",1
youre having a really hard time right now.,1
"i know it might seem hopeless and impossible to get out of, but thats the depression wearing you down.",1
keep talking to people who will listen.,1
i dont know if that will help with the guilt or if it will help your familys situation but i think it might be important for you  in the future.,1
consider showing him what youve typed here if you cant tell him.,1
"even if you think the cuts will stop bleeding on their own, please call anyway.",1
"its okay if it wasnt a suicide attempt or not, the details arent as important as getting the bleeding stopped.",1
"youre welcome, come back anytime.",1
contact a lawyer if you have phone privileges.,1
"if you dont, have someone else contact a lawyer for you.",1
"if these hallucinations are generally happening when you are sleepy, waking, or going to sleep, please consider talking to your doctor about doing a sleep study.",1
"i think its also important to note that modafinil, a drug to combat the effects of sleepiness, has helped to an extent.",1
you can also talk to your doctor about  methods to help you distinguish between what is actually happening and what youre experiencing.,1
"while your doctor may have prescribed them for your hallucinations, dont take that as a diagnosis, just as a diagnostic tool.",1
i dont think delusional disorder factors into it.,1
"i hope the op gets any help they need, legally and medically.",1
"it sucks to have the police show up, but dont let that scare you away from getting some help.",1
youre not doing anything wrong.,1
it can be heart wrenching to reach out and have no response.,1
that isnt a reflection upon you.,1
"i know you feel that you are nothing, and while it may not alleviate that feeling, i dont think you are.",1
youre a person who absolutely has thoughts and feelings.,1
"that is something, even if it feels horrible.",1
"i personally think that the ability to experience is something that gives us all value, every living thing.",1
i have to suspect that that may not make you feel better.,1
"i also wish i could say something to give you hope, something to soothe your pain.",1
"i know that wishes dont accomplish things on their own, but i hope that my wishes for you can maybe demonstrate that you do have worth.",1
i dont think that value and worth are determined by others.,1
"while i believe you are valuable, its not my place to assign that value to you.",1
you already have it just by being.,1
"when im being honest, i feel a similar way.",1
"in my mind, it is how i will die.",1
i dont know if thats conditioning from feeling suicidal or a result of mental illness or practicality or whatever.,1
"it does feel like a pointless wheel, seemingly endless cycles and then the wheel comes off the spoke and its over.",1
"however, i want to think that it doesnt necessarily matter if we do kill ourselves in the future.",1
"as hard as it is for me to personally to see it otherwise, we dont live in the future, it hasnt happened yet.",1
getting through the feeling now can seem futile and pointless but i try to consider how i feel when i do get through that feeling.,1
i dont feel that way when im out of it.,1
im not sure if that made sense.,1
"i personally dont find  comforting but i also dont want to be ruled by things that havent occurred, no matter how likely i feel they may be.",1
"if we build stairs, we wouldnt learn as much and our stairs wouldnt get as high, without those mistakes.",1
i apologize for the metaphor but it really helps me gather what i want to say.,1
"i also want to note that our stairs, our walls, or our piles of bricks arent what define our lives.",1
our mistakes or what we think of as mistakes dont make up our whole person.,1
"were also not defined, i think, by how our mistakes compare with others.",1
"youre not a waste, youre not a bad person.",1
"youre still growing and we all are always growing, even a little.",1
i feel the same way about my cats.,1
"i am also disability and if i were suddenly alone, i wouldnt be homeless, but i would no longer be able to support my cats.",1
i feel that it would be the end of my life as well.,1
would your ex take the cats without your death?,1
"i know that probably isnt much better but it could be a chance for you to figure something out about how to keep them, if you could get them back.",1
my heart really goes out to you.,1
"if you do ever find another therapist, print this out and give it to them.",1
i wish i could express what things are like as well as this.,1
im sorry your life has been like this.,1
"youre welcome, i hope someone can come up with some practical advice.",1
i hope you make it through these times.,1
lots of lies and avoidance and guilt and shame.,1
it tough to say what will convince your friend she needs help.,1
"all you can really do is try to be understanding, keep putting yourself out there as her friend.",1
try something out of the norm like sending a letter explaining that you miss her.,1
"sometimes people just want to be heard by their friends, having solutions pushed to the forefront can be pretty overwhelming.",1
its more than okay to be angry about your friend lying.,1
"if possible, try not to let that color future interactions.",1
"i cant speak for your friend and cant know why she lied but i know that for me, it felt like a necessity.",1
we sometimes do unfortunate things when it feels like a matter of survival.,1
"the biggest thing to remember, and i think the toughest, is that you can lead a horse to water but you cant make her drink.",1
it sounds like youre being a good friend by not giving up on her and wanting her to have help.,1
"ive had friends like you, and not to make this about me, but i pain sometimes thinking about how i couldnt return that friendship.",1
"i hope things work out, i truly do.",1
i think it really depends on the individual and the environment.,1
"talking to some people can make things worse, talking to other people can make things better.",1
"in regards to judgement, ive found it a lot easier to talk about my problems with strangers.",1
i can always end contact with someone not in my life or on the internet.,1
"sometimes, being depression doesnt hinge on how good our lives might be.",1
i dont think you sound like youre being dramatic.,1
its extremely frustrating to not be able to pull yourself out of feeling this way.,1
i dont know what your situation is like at home but please keep trying with your parents.,1
something to try might be to write down what your day is like.,1
write down what you do and how you feel.,1
its hard to see any point to life when feeling as you do.,1
"please keep talking to people, keep trying, its the only way to find the answer for yourself.",1
"i just wanted to say that i dont think there really is a  being nice might be a hindrance in some areas of life, you might have more trouble with some things, but kindness is, i think, the most beautiful thing about any human being.",1
"being kind is something that ive struggled with, personally.",1
i have had some very unkind periods of my life that i feel some regret about.,1
"hang onto your niceness, try to see it as an investment in your future.",1
"as you grow, it could become a great asset.",1
i think everything is or becomes colored by whatever feelings drive this kind of thinking.,1
"i know that when i am thinking about suicide or in a deep depression, there is no other option.",1
"it seems right and it seems as if it will happen, not a matter of if or when.",1
i cant say this is how it is or will be for you but in my own experience its a matter of making it through those times.,1
"making it until, for whatever unexplainable reason, i can think about other things and other options.",1
"i dislike saying,  especially since i cant say you will experience things the way i have.",1
"time is a resource we all have, even if it can be unbearable to pass.",1
i absolutely wish i could tell you something tangible or useful.,1
"i think whatever you ultimately choose, you deserve respect and understanding.",1
i hope that if you choose to continue that youll feel free to keep talking here or to come back at a later date.,1
i hear you on that one hundred percent.,1
"i havent used any hotlines before because im actually afraid of the same thing, but i hope someone can come along with some suggestions about good ones.",1
i consider humiliation to be one of the strongest feelings throughout my life.,1
"for me, humiliation takes on a life of its own.",1
i know that it might not matter what people think but that doesnt change the effect that humiliation has on me.,1
"i dont really know what to do either, aside from avoiding situations where i know or suspect ill feel humiliated.",1
i dont know if that can be ive done a lot of things to try to work around it.,1
i dont really know what you should do.,1
there are a lot of people hidden in this world with similar feelings and experiences.,1
i hope you find something helpful.,1
"i cant really tell you not to dwell on your height, i know what its like",1
you dont have to go through this alone.,1
people can find you help for these medical problems.,1
there are good people out there who provide jobs that you can live on.,1
but your life really can get better.,1
i understand that getting back to where you were can be very hard.,1
but there is no shame in going through struggles.,1
people will be understanding about what you are going through.,1
"i know it is hard, but you can find a passion for university and life again.",1
you can make a meaningful and enjoyable life for yourself.,1
you have been dealt a bad hand in life but you can overcome all of your problems.,1
talking your problems out can help.,1
please talk to someone about this.,1
they want to help you and see you happy,1
this is something you can get help with.,1
i know it sucks but it really can get better.,1
find a support group and people who know exactly what youre going through.,1
there are other ways to make your life better than just anti-depressants alone.,1
there are people that love and care about you.,1
there are trained professionals that can help.,1
people want to help you and can find you help,1
maybe you just havent been talking to the right people.,1
there is someone out there that can help you.,1
"please dont lose hope, it really can get better.",1
you can find a way to escape the situation you are in that isnt through death.,1
please take sauletekis up on their offer to help,1
dont give up hope yet; sauletekis is trying to find you a way.,1
you can find a way out of your misery.,1
you can find a way to be happy.,1
your parents love you and want the best for you .,1
talk to a counselor at school to help you figure out a career path.,1
talk to your boyfriend about how you are feeling with your relationship.,1
take some more time so you can look at the situation when you have a clearer mind.,1
your family and friends can help get you back on track.,1
ask for help in brainstorming how to improve your situation.,1
they can help you learn to accomplish what you want to.,1
you can find a way to make life enjoyable.,1
talk to your roommate and explain how you are feeling.,1
"you put the pills away, that is an incredibly good first step",1
if they dont know about your problems they cant help.,1
you can find people to support you.,1
you can find a way through this.,1
your friends and family can help you.,1
there are people who want to help you and can help you.,1
it sounds like both you and your fiance are going through a hard time right now.,1
dont take the negative things that she says to you personally.,1
she is under a lot of stress and doesnt mean it.,1
please find a place to help you with your addiction.,1
there are many clinics that can help you.,1
try to talk to your mom about this.,1
they care about you and want to see you doing better.,1
keep trying new ways to solve your problems.,1
"it may seem overwhelming now, but when life becomes beautiful again, it will seem even more beautiful in comparison to the bad parts.",1
"i know its hard to look towards the future and to move forward, but you can do it.",1
just moving forward will help you in this fight against depression.,1
try researching them to find ways to get over this bad period in your life.,1
please give it some more time.,1
"can you try to work something out with your school, especially in regards to your parents taking your money?",1
try to talk to one of their financial aid counselors.,1
can you take any community college classes instead?,1
try to find someone you can talk to.,1
talk to your brother and tell him how you are feeling.,1
"please, try talking to some people in your new country.",1
try to hang out with coworkers after work.,1
"find people with hobbies you have in common, or find new hobbies to try.",1
good things really can happen.,1
try to go to different doctors to find a medical diagnosis.,1
"it sounds like you could have depression, which can be helped and treated.",1
"i know friday might seem like its far away now, but please just hang in there.",1
if you give up now youll never get to transition and youll never get to feel as comfortable as i know you deserve.,1
"hey, sorry i was late in getting back to you.",1
"i know im just a stranger on the internet, but trust me, it will happen for you.",1
i wanted to kill myself back when i was 15 too.,1
seven years since i decided to keep on living and see what would happen.,1
"im not a transgender person myself, but i do know that at 15 your life has barely even begun.",1
"i can only imagine that it goes double for you, as youre still yet to transition to your true gender, the true you.",1
"like somebody else said, take it one day at a time.",1
just know that you can always come back here if you ever feel your oedema of extremity going over the edge.,1
"ive been working my mind thinking of something to say and i keep drawing a blank, and its because i dont know anything about you.",1
"so i want to know more about you, so before you do what you think is right  you got to let me learn a bit about, i wanna know a guy before hes gone.",1
"itd be a shame if it was a small bureaucratic formality that killed you, im hoping for me its either shark attack or death by bees.",1
guess it depends on your concept of living.,1
"theres something you cant say, or dont want to.",1
"i wish i could know more, i hope you find a concept to live for",1
"itd be the equivalent of a butterfly that alights from a flower, ruffling the flatulence/wind that annoys the undercover sniper that accidentally pulls the trigger on methats cool, im going to steal that.",1
i can see why people say youre smart.,1
"i really wish you hadnt experienced the things that kept causing you to be disappointed over and over, it sounds like a heavy load and that sucks.",1
"nothing wrong with a little failure, im well versed in failure, i like to consider myself a master of failure.",1
"its good that you believe in things, even if it does end in heartbreak.",1
"i hope you get over this, you have a long time to commit suicide and you dont need to rush it, im contemplating suicide by old age.",1
"dont thank me, its important i meet interesting people.",1
a controversial opinion you have?,1
can you remember when you were most scared?,1
if you were told you had 24 hours to live what would you do?,1
"i know these questions seem a little odd but id really appreciate you answering them, whenever you get time.",1
it sounds like you have a lovely friendship with nicola.,1
"stop calling yourself useless, youre not.",1
"youre not a spare cog, youre important.",1
"so you havent got a job, kudos on you quitting a job that made you unhappy and unwell.",1
"please talk to nicola and tell her how youre feeling, and how shes helped you and been an important part of your life.",1
try to remember that most of lifes best moments havent happened yet.,1
just be understanding and supportive when he needs you to be.,1
the rest of the time just be his sister.,1
although i would say it is very possible that she can be in denial and afraid to come to grips with your diagnosis.,1
if you feel you need the meds then you would be wise to let that be know to your doctor or therapist so they can back you up.,1
ive know many people afflicted by this disorder and for many medication is the only way to have a  life.,1
ask your doctor to play with the dosage of your meds to keep the side effects as minimal as possible.,1
why are you messing with this guy?,1
dont be overly concerned with a diagnosis from an er doctor.,1
"if you have a doctor you have been seeing and that knows you decently well, i would consider their word of much more value.",1
not even going to read that all.,1
looking for a diagnosis online is not appropriate.,1
"if she is saying that she is worried and doesnt know of she can control herself, you need to call an ambulance.",1
it will get better if you try.,1
i have meet people who have said they generally dont feel anyway but normal or how they regularly feel.,1
no feeling angry or feeling unhappy or changes in mood.,1
"i would say that for those that do feel a strong emotional upset component, they may be better diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.",1
"go to the er, show the dr your old medicine and explain how you cant currently get any but are struggling without it.",1
you shouldnt be hospitalized if you tell them you are not currently a threat to yourself but are concerned you may be if not helped soon.,1
hopefully the dr will be kind enough to understand and write you a scrip for a while.,1
in that time you need to find yourself a local clinic or psych in private practice to get you back on your regiment.,1
"youll see how the meds affect you, if you are unhappy with the results then you speak with the dr about trying something else.",1
if it means anything it sounds like you did the right thing.,1
if you tell them you are not currently experiencing si/hi or command hallucinations they should not be able to hold you.,1
give yourself time to figure this out.,1
get the treatment you need and life can and will be just what you wanted it to be.,1
if she has made suicidal threats you should contact ems as soon as possible.,1
"listen things will be ok, you need to get yourself some help.",1
get your mood back up and then you will see there is hope.,1
once your feeling a bit better youre gonna take sometime and learn the things you need to know to find a partner and the other things you want for your future.,1
youre best bet is to talk to her and get her to voluntarily seek help.,1
otherwise she is an adult and cant be forced until something happens that would force legal issues to force her.,1
use taking care of her kids as a point to try and catch her rational side.,1
diagnostic criteria is really a way to try and create a spectrum to try and measure what can only be reported by the client.,1
you shouldnt feel like you  anything to him.,1
what you did is get him the help he needs.,1
"i am not schizophrenic, i am actually a licensed therapist and from a clinical perspective you absolutely did what was needed.",1
it sounds like he was havin a pretty severe manic episode.,1
i know this is all very scary  but ive had to call ems on people i love and clients alike i can say you can rest easier now knowing he is safe and will be helped.,1
i hear very often that people need to hear these things again.,1
"often when feeling suicidal, we tend to forget even the most cliche of things.",1
"i jokingly say that even without one on, some many people assume that what youre doing anyway.",1
"youre not being a bitch, and you dont have to  anyone; youre depression and you may just want someone to listen to you.",1
theres nothing you have to apologize for.,1
"ill listen, if you feel like talking.",1
that  reaction is the worst- to me it always feels less like real concern and more like pity .,1
"you do have to fight demons primarily on your own, and i know you feel more and more hopeless, but you still do have some left, it seems.",1
"i hate to make it into a  story, but i can understand where youre coming from.",1
"it sucks to be twenty and already feel like youve wasted so much time being a pointless burden on everyone elses life, like everyone else is moving a hundred miles an hour with their lives and im stuck on a bike with a broken wheel or something.",1
"but i will say, youre in school, you have a job, and even a girlfriend- maybe you really arent a total failure?",1
its a sad fucking world where you as a trans person almost have to expect such gross messages.,1
youre a person and you deserve freaking gratitude and common courtesy.,1
a lot of people have been where you are and made better lives for themselves.,1
if you dont want to see that though theres nothing we can do to help you.,1
there isnt any point to anything so why end it?,1
so what if none of the socially constructed ideas of the meaning of life really mean anything?,1
does that really change anything or just your perception of it?,1
was parkour the only thing that really made you want to keep living?,1
dont you think that there might be something in life that could appeal to you at the same level that parkour does?,1
"were only here for a short time and then we can spend the rest of our time in hell, in the dirt or whatever the fuck you believe.",1
why try and force something that will happen naturally?,1
but that doesnt mean there arent the good parts.,1
"smoke a bowl, eat some food and revel in the fact that you do exist and that you are here.",1
does it matter that you lack any identifying factors from those around you?,1
does it matter who gives a shit about your name after youre dead?,1
its the feeling that your entire life will be as shitty as it is then.,1
i thought it would end in high school but its my first year of college and it isnt different.,1
i know exactly how you feel with people.,1
women are often attracted to me but i feel like i cant connect with others like they do to me.,1
i know someone else just like this as well and ive had the exact same conversation with him where we ask:,1
we both know what happens when we die.,1
you dont know where it will lead or if it will even be good.,1
if there is nothing that you can fathom that could be behind the door of uncertainty that can make you happy then sure.,1
you just better be fucking sure and not do this after drinking while on anti depressants next to daddys gun closet.,1
we all know how its going to end.,1
for me i just hope its not full of regret.,1
right now you have something to live for.,1
"even if you dont win your daughter, that doesnt mean that you cant ever visit her.",1
"you should ask the judge that if you lose, that you at least can keep track of her.",1
and that youll be the 2nd parent if where she lives right now turns out too bad.,1
"and if you cant ever visit her, you can tell her when she turns 18 what a bitch her mom was.",1
"your feeling angry and pain would probably have calmed down by then, but it gives you a goal.",1
"like what if he meant to imply something like that youll be a new man by the time you leave the class, leaving the old behind or shedding the old you as if to put it to death.",1
or that the class is highly difficult and stressful as to bring one to their wits end.,1
"i do think its unlikely that hed actually mean what he said literally, but even if he did, think of what kind of person it would take to actually say that in such a situation.",1
is that the kind of person whose opinion youd weigh your life on?,1
"the answer either way is to keep it up, and dont forget to enjoy it!",1
dont look to reddit to solve your problems.,1
"oh, and dont kill yourself either.",1
"; for a start, if you had no value you wouldnt have the job.",1
youre right to question this stuff.,1
"for now, do your homework so you can pass school and learn stuff then go out into the adult world where you have more control over your decisions.",1
ill be honest and say i dont have an answer.,1
but heres a lame child-like analogy.,1
yet still you choose to build one and lovingly craft it and even look forward to it.,1
but the thing is people do love you.,1
if your parents didnt care at all they wouldnt even be putting food on the table.,1
parents can be very bad at parenting but it doesnt mean mood they dont have feelings.,1
if you only knew how young that is!,1
how much time you have to do things.,1
"whatever youve screwed up, youve barely started.",1
in 10 years everything you think youve messed up noone will care about anyway.,1
plenty of time to be dead later.,1
its the only way you learn anything.,1
"come on, you are stronger than you think.",1
actually you can learn confidence.,1
sure its harder for some pplespecially after a lifetime of no confidence or setbacks.,1
but its still sth you can learn.,1
google how to learn charisma etc youll find theres stuff out there.,1
we simply unlearn it from bad life experiences.,1
that sounds pretty devastating.,1
can you not return at all  or you can go back in a year?,1
"not a particularly pleasant experience sure, but it gives you a chance to take time out to sort stuff out.",1
i wont try and play things down.,1
having big setbacks in life is horrible.,1
but it doesnt have to be the end.,1
"you are lucky to have such good relationships and people who care about you, and you are obviously a considerate person.",1
youve at least thought a bit about the impact your death would have by your desire to choose a less violent method.,1
btw i like your thing with the dieresis on su\xc3\xafcide.,1
sounds like you know a bit about linguistics.,1
maybe you could go into teaching english one day.,1
you dont necessarily need a college degree.,1
if you have been doing poorly in studies is there a reason perhaps?,1
or do you have an undiagnosed learning disorder?,1
if youre just finding the course too hard maybe you can speak with your tutors to get extra help.,1
have you confided in your friends and family how distressed youre feeling?,1
sorry to hear youre in such a lonely situation.,1
its normal to feel that way when basic emotional needs arent met.,1
what sort of jobs are you applying for?,1
all that rejection can be soul-destroying so youve done well to persevere despite it.,1
is there a job agency nearby that can help?,1
is it that you have no good friends to turn to or that you have good friends who are too far away?,1
not the same as meeting in person but its something.,1
there are much less horrific ways.,1
youd be surprised how often that happens.,1
faces cant be put back together.,1
feeling sand between your toes on the beach.,1
remember moods come and go all the time like clouds.,1
never make permanent decisions based on your current mental state which is subject to change.,1
think youll find a lot of ppl in history have felt similarly.,1
even your random  thoughts about suicide you are not alone in.,1
pyouve done well to get a job so you can probably get another.,1
so maybe ppl around you dont like you.,1
but there are a lot of ppl out there who like weirdos.,1
youre right that its not simple.,1
feeling like you are past the final straw and too burnt out to try again after so many failed attempts i can sympathise with.,1
no matter what has happened in the past i dont think you can preempt the future.,1
i dont know who this is referring to.,1
its certainly not true in my experience.,1
you can say that if you continue as you are that things are unlikely to change but the only time you can say categorically 100% that things will  is if you are dead.,1
"on a more macabre note, if you mean mood jumping off bridges in a literal sense please dont.",1
its true that modern society is not as accommodating as it should be to highly sensitive people.,1
but there are ways to channel it.,1
there is still time to have a new life.,1
who cares whether its of use to anyone else?,1
then its about creating things that have enough value to other ppl that they will pay you for them.,1
which youre already doing by working.,1
"you are providing value to the world, ie some useful service or product, which is why your company pays you.",1
but as for things you care about things have value simly because people ascribe value to them.,1
if you paint a picture you like then it has value because you give it value.,1
if someone else doesnt like it thats too bad.,1
if you enjoy doing something and other people dont who cares?,1
it doesnt make you enjoy it less.,1
maybe you love camping and everyone else cant stand it.,1
but that doesnt stop you enjoying camping and getting pleasure from it.,1
i know it can be devastating to lose someone who has come to define you.,1
you can find yourself ripped apart.,1
but maybe thats also a chance to reform yourself.,1
"suicide is not the kind of decision for ambiguity, although this is very common.",1
but it is the one decision in life that really demands an .,1
that really its not annihilating ourselves were craving but simply to destroy our old lives and start again.,1
as in we confuse wanting to kill ourselves with wanting to kill life itself.,1
it is possible to reconstruct yourself and start over without ending everything.,1
"even if charm and charisma cant ever be learnt or developed, why do you have to kill yourself if you are not successful in developing them?",1
there are plenty of uncharismatic ppl who arent suicidal.,1
you dont have to ooze charisma or be george clooney to have ppl like you.,1
most ppl do just fine without that.,1
"if you want to be the life and soul of the party, sure.",1
"a great thing to aspire to, to becone that sociable etc.",1
sounds like you have a big focus on value.,1
maybe your challenge is to think about what it is that really motivates you and work to develop sth in that area.,1
this doesnt happen overnight btw.,1
the point of being smart is to use that smartness to develop yourself.,1
its what you do with it that counts.,1
just like being born with money.,1
try and work out what drives you and how you can make that useful to others.,1
"no matter how much it hurts, your life is worth far more than any relationship.",1
no woman is ever worth losing your life to.,1
i know what it is like to go through a ton of shit.,1
"shit, even today, i think my life sucks so bad that i should just check out.",1
and i am pretty sure i am twice your age .,1
life throws some pretty depressed mood stuff at you sometimes.,1
just like i will.,1
and it will make you stronger.,1
but please dont chest pain yourself - because then they win.,1
"ive been reading your comments here, they seem pretty helpful :",1
sorry youre still having a rough time.,1
im glad the meds are helping a bit though.,1
"and your therapist is right i think, thoughts are just thoughts.",1
"maybe you cant prevent them from coming into your head, but you can work on ignoring them and not giving them the attention they want.",1
this is kind of what mindfulness targets.,1
"i like your positive paragraph, glad you can see some good :",1
is there anyone in your life you can trust and talk to?,1
i get what you mean mood by being a burden.,1
im sure your friends have reassured you that youre not though.,1
it takes time to get over someone and move on.,1
but you have to give yourself the chance.,1
i dont have anything to work on or any hobbies or anything like that.,1
cutting would help to fill the boredom.,1
"im sure they would but im too scared, i guess i want someone i know.",1
not eating is only going to make you feel worse.,1
"have something small, or go out for food.",1
sorry about all the duplicate comments haha.,1
i dont know how that happened.,1
well i guess im glad you have to put it off.,1
please seek help in the meantime.,1
try to put it off for as long as you can.,1
what kind of job are you looking for?,1
how about you go and find out?,1
you dont need to tell them youre suicidal unless you want to.,1
"if you know it isnt youre anxiety mental depression causing this stuff, tell them that.",1
help them narrow down what it could be.,1
"it seems you want help with your physical health first, because thats what is causing all the rest, and thats fine.",1
"tell them the truth, and get medical help.",1
"maybe they will put you on antidepressants, but they wont ignore your physical ailments.",1
im glad youre willing to go to the hospital.,1
"you know, its a good thing youre bad at that.",1
"it hurts to have yet another failure, i understand that.",1
but im glad youre still around.,1
"if you want to just chat, ill talk with you.",1
this is a pretty good explanation.,1
"i always imagine more cuts will give me a better release but by the time i do it, a few is enough.",1
its programming/software development.,1
can you talk to your parents about things?,1
why is she kicking you out after youve helped so much.,1
sorry things are going poorly.,1
im assuming youre in university/college.,1
i should at least give it a shot.,1
if she really wants to help she should respect that.,1
"im sorry this happened, sounds rough.",1
"let her keep tabs on you, but be honest and tell her youre feeling pressured.",1
getting drunk isnt that great.,1
im glad youre giving it a shot.,1
mention how youre feeling please.,1
i dont really understand how everyone feels so good after.,1
i guess i mostly feel relieved.,1
like exhaling a really deep breath.,1
"so i mean mood, it feels good.",1
but not like a high.,1
because im an idiot with horrible priorities.,1
and my backlog of homework was too much.,1
pretty much feel the exact same way as you .,1
i dont think talking about getting over that would even be allowed here.,1
but that instinct exists for a reason.,1
my family and my friends missing me has no impact on that for me either.,1
"it would suck to be forced into therapy, and thats avoidable by either willingly going, or finding another support.",1
what do you mean mood by lying to yourself about lifes problems?,1
whats gotten you to this point?,1
"im glad you have hope things might change, thats important.",1
"thats good, im glad to hear back from you.",1
im doing so much better than a few weeks ago.,1
that sucks and sounds like a hard situation.,1
their threat of military school sounds like  at helping you out.,1
"they dont want you gone from the planet, i know that.",1
im sorry they would preach to you.,1
"maybe you could just mention that you need real help, and not from them necessarily but youd appreciate them helping you find it.",1
"military school doesnt sound like a good solution, but there are things that can help.",1
"i selfharm too, its stupid and sucky and i keep it from my parents.",1
but when youre on the edge you need to try everything first.,1
i dont know what you should say to your parents that would help you the most.,1
but there has to be something.,1
maybe for tonight you could just go to the emergency room and say how youre feeling.,1
i dont know if thats possible for you but its an alternative to telling your parents and its a way better option than killing yourself.,1
no one will be better with you gone.,1
"i know how youre feeling, i feel the same way often.",1
but i know deep down its not true.,1
i took it throughout school so id say i know a bunch.,1
"and it isnt so much being in france, except for the lack of support i suppose.",1
i just dont see the point in doing anything extra.,1
"i understand that, but how does my brain know to jump to depressed mood itself to feel better.",1
"i dont even know, my question doesnt make much sense to even me.",1
basically boils down to whhhyy,1
"hey, i saw your comment on the other post.",1
im sorry things are so bad for you right now.,1
what if you just try telling your parents about your struggles?,1
"you dont need to lay it all out at once, but please make an attempt.",1
if its too hard to say maybe write it down or email them or something.,1
"i know they expect a lot of you, but theyd rather you not meet those expectations than be dead.",1
i also think youre being much harder on yourself than theyd ever be.,1
but youll never know if you dont try talking.,1
or even just first make an attempt at letting your parents know.,1
i know it wont make things better.,1
"but you have nothing to lose at this point, trying to get help  is worth a shot.",1
what kind of person does that?,1
recovery is a long process though.,1
"you didnt ruin anything, youre still recovering.",1
"its alright, just get up again and keep going.",1
"hey, same thing happens to me.",1
"i dont get why people would be my friend, so i ask.",1
or dont talk to them for a long time.,1
i have no one to talk to either and i feel sad as well.,1
"its good you dont think youll kill yourself, but the thoughts are pretty scary.",1
awesome im glad things went well!,1
"even if you were, people would prefer you to be alive than dead.",1
theres nothing you could do where the appropriate response  would be to kill yourself.,1
im sorry things arent working out right now.,1
why do you feel like a burden exactly?,1
"by the way, i feel like a burden too.",1
sounds like fun.,1
asking stuff like this is against the rules.,1
its a bad habit to start and really hard to stop.,1
please talk to someone about it instead of doing it.,1
cutting doesnt solve anything.,1
hard not to talk about it when its on my mind nearly always.,1
"thank you for making the call, great job.",1
"im sorry, youre not worthless though.",1
and if you really werent worth her time:,1
theres nothing wrong with you.,1
i have spotty coverage right now so i probably wont be able to reply for awhile.,1
"help is coming, please stick around.",1
"i know you said you dont have anybody, but please try to reach out.",1
from there you can piece things together and get to a point where you want to live.,1
"if youre sure about your decision, at least before you go, could you give a little more details about your situation?",1
im sure others will comment here soon too.,1
well ive been eating a lot of chocolate if that counts.,1
"it is something to be wary of, you dont want to replace one bad habit with another.",1
im sorry she moved on so fast.,1
dont let her actions decide whether youre loved or wanted.,1
"things didnt work out with her, but you are still loved.",1
and the time you spent with her wasnt a waste.,1
"it isnt fair i agree, its hard and stupid.",1
"youve made it from january to now, you can keep going.",1
seems like a bad meal if you ask me.,1
whats gotten you to this point?,1
i imagine things that i want to create by painting or drawing or whatever.,1
you can still create things though!,1
i enjoy programming and try to use that to build/contribute what i like to pretend is art.,1
"anyway, theres probably something like that for you too.",1
"i dont have any advice sadly, but theres no such thing as a worthwhile life.",1
whatever you do or can do is enough.,1
/ caring for them like that though is too expensive/hard.,1
especially if they hardly bleed.,1
"yeah, i know what you mean mood.",1
i told a friend awhile back that i wish she could see herself how i saw her.,1
and that i wish i could see myself how everyone else saw me.,1
"it sucks that its much easier to see the good in others, but i guess it shows youre caring.",1
"i know its hard, but looking out for yourself is really important.",1
what are like to have as pets?,1
"and honestly, that sounds like a good reason not to kill yourself.",1
"stick around for their sake, and keep trying with everything else.",1
"they need you, and you probably need them.",1
are you getting any help with how youre feeling?,1
2 years ago i decided the same thing.,1
"no strings attached either, i im almost certain ill end up killing myself by then.",1
"i also feel fine right now, i dont know.",1
it would probably be a good idea to though.,1
so i suppose the same applies for you.,1
"i like what /u/ruthluss said, its an unresolved issue even though youre feeling okay right now.",1
"i dont have any advice sadly, but i think i know exactly how you feel.",1
"i hope i dont kill myself before 25, but as happy as i am right now i cant imagine living more than 5 years more.",1
"i hope youre still around, please keep trying.",1
make one last attempt at getting help.,1
"everyone has treated you very poorly, thats not your fault.",1
you dont need to die because of how youve been treated.,1
"i saw you posting to help others out, great job.",1
"im sorry youre having such a hard time, but ive noticed you can see the good in small things.",1
"yeah getting better immediately wont happen, but you are strong enough to get better slowly.",1
im glad you have your family to keep you here.,1
"i know you wish you could just die, but sticking around is a good thing, and you have a good reason to:",1
a family that loves and needs you.,1
youre going through a rough time.,1
but i know you can push through it!,1
you were important and valuable before you met her.,1
im here for a year for an internship.,1
dont you think 5 days is long enough?,1
"i get up motivation to do something, then i cant because its too overwhelming.",1
then i hate myself more for not trying etc.,1
"i know youre not crazy, and im sorry they tried to lock you up.",1
im really sorry everything is going how it is for you.,1
why not try writing something now?,1
doesnt need to be big or major.,1
im feeling pretty good right now so im not going to address what you said really.,1
but im the only one pressuring me.,1
"its alright, im doing a bit better now.",1
what about parents or friends?,1
im sorry you dont have anyone to talk to.,1
whats gotten you wanting to cut?,1
i do it to bleed and for the scars.,1
i dont even do it when im upset anymore.,1
im not exactly trying to stop.,1
i think it just makes me ugly/worthless so im trying to avoid it.,1
wanting to do it and trying not to is so upsetting though.,1
"thats all ive done today, avoided cutting.",1
i wish the day was over already.,1
last time you posted here you said it was helpful.,1
i hope posting again can be just as helpful.,1
everything you said in this post about the rest of us applies to you too!,1
"i read through your post history, you gave others helpful advice.",1
you told them the reasons they have to live and how much theyre worth.,1
all of these things apply to you as well.,1
"i saw you have pet rats, whats that like?",1
sounds like a fun pet to have.,1
call 911 or something equivalent.,1
or get yourself to the hospital.,1
"you clearly dont want to do this, please take the steps to help yourself.",1
"if youre confused, reaching out here was a good decision.",1
and people here are here to help you out.,1
would probably be elevated mood to talk about things in the meantime anyway.,1
im too lazy to or i feel like it doesnt really deserve/need any attention besides making sure it isnt bleeding.,1
honestly youre not ugly at all.,1
you could find a girlfriend who looked like whatever you wanted.,1
but its probably more important to find someone you like.,1
"being confident would help, because heres another truth:",1
you deserve to see yourself better.,1
im not lying to make you feel better.,1
im telling you the full truth because you need to hear it.,1
"for me, as long as i feel good going into the test im alright with whatever grade.",1
being prepared helps but so does attitude.,1
"and no, i cant really speak it at all.",1
"thanks for the replies, im heading to bed now.",1
no its not a fun way to live at all.,1
"but hey, keep banging on the wall!",1
"i dont know, giving up seems so easy and like the better choice right now.",1
"but fighting issue the brave, strong choice.",1
and i knows youre strong enough to.,1
youve been well before im sure.,1
i dont want to say  because it sounds mean mood.,1
"but really, pushing on can be so much more rewarding.",1
i dont know if it will be for myself.,1
what does gaping mean mood exactly?,1
"you deleted that post, but from the comments i can see youre not ugly.",1
"i dont want to give you life advice and say be confident, because thats easier said than done.",1
your issue isnt being ugly though.,1
please reach out and get some help.,1
have you seen someone for your anxiety mental depression and mental depression?,1
"its alright though, dont worry.",1
not to talk about op behind her/his back butim sure they called .,1
"hello /u/addicted7, i was just thinking about you earlier this week.",1
i know exactly what you mean mood.,1
ive been late a lot the past two weeks.,1
"i feel like cutting while at school so often, but i always try to just put it off until im home.",1
which helps me sedated state down a bit by giving it time.,1
what helps me is having someone to force me to get things done.,1
"but you know, someone who makes sure i get it done.",1
and helps me along the way with reminders or whatever.,1
"try breaking things down into smaller, manageable problems.",1
"finally, dont kill yourself if you dont finish your homework.",1
"i hope that doesnt sound too harsh, because i dont mean mood it to be.",1
really whats the worst thing that could happen if you didnt finish your work?,1
i am 100% sure it isnt as bad as dying.,1
the other persons comment is probably more helpful.,1
i guess my main point is i can relate.,1
but i know you can continue through this ache.,1
"feeling like this no matter what your reason is fine, theres not a list of good reasons and bad reasons.",1
"it sucks you feel like this, and i hope you feel better.",1
are you getting any professional help?,1
just went to the hospital for a few days and at least for now im feeling better.,1
it would text you but last time i did that i wasted $30.,1
pm me and ill send you my email.,1
i took a class on that last semester and dropped it because.,1
"s i hope i did well, like i said i was confident going in.",1
i feel the exact same way man.,1
this life is much too hard and unfair.,1
literally all we can do is suck it up and continue.,1
"youre not as bad as you think, i promise you that.",1
im sorry you feel like this.,1
"/u/cameroncac is right, you  have to push through.",1
talk to someone before you do anything.,1
im sorry things have been so hard.,1
im glad you posted though and i hope the people here can help.,1
"youre in college, they probably have free walkin counselling services there.",1
dont be so hard on yourself please.,1
"like i said, theres nothing wrong with you.",1
"i dont know why she broke up with you, but thats her mistake.",1
you can continue life and pick things back up again even without her.,1
i like programming.,1
but this semester is going horribly wrong.,1
i wish i could stop my downward spiral.,1
"youre right about things, its just i really dont know what the issue is.",1
and when the smallest thing goes wrong i let it really upset me.,1
"its usually school related things, i feel like a failure for not completing what i know i can.",1
"i guess to cope, it helps me sedated state down when im feeling overwhelmed .",1
"i also do it to feel in control, because when i do it, no one else can stop me and i guess feeling powerful over myself is comforting.",1
and i sort of see it as a minisuicide.,1
i cant kill myself but at least i can chest pain myself.,1
also i kind of like how it looks.,1
i didnt mean mood it like that.,1
all i was trying to say was how you see yourself might not be true.,1
all those things you listed are facts.,1
i really didnt mean mood to sound rude or presumptuous.,1
"you dont need to say anything nice, its fine.",1
"it sucks, hope youre doing alright.",1
"if you cant do it, maybe someone here can for you .",1
or text someone you know and ask them to call.,1
i know she doesnt view me poorly or anything.,1
i just dont want to anxiety her or upset her but thats all i can manage doing with pretty much anyone.,1
"i dont mind her knowing because shes nice about it, but her seeing the razors made it more real.",1
"maybe you should start a blog, just post what youre thinking where no one can downvote it.",1
"yeah zelda-cdi has been talked to death, but its still fun to mock!",1
i suck at mw3 and its so frustrating because when playing you dont get much time to get better before dying.,1
"also your post about the easter flame thing was pretty informative, ive never heard about it before.",1
"i dont think its ever been posted on /r/christianity even, ive been going there daily for the past 3 years.",1
"anyway, talk about your problems to a counsellor.",1
be honest because it really helps.,1
i care about your dumb history facts and your life.,1
youre not failing at everything.,1
ive been reading your posts and im so glad youre getting help and were able to be honest with your husband.,1
"its great he is so supportive, i hope things go well.",1
"you can do this, just take it one step at a time.",1
do you think you could hold out for one more day?,1
and give getting help a chance.,1
"good insight, i see what you mean mood with our subconscious knowing it will produce an endorphin rush.",1
"thanks for the long reply, i appreciate it.",1
some of the more complicated or longer posts here never get replies because people arent sure what to say.,1
im sorry people have ignored your posts.,1
i care that you chest pain yourself.,1
and i appreciate you giving people advice.,1
"i dont know what to say, and i think thats the main thing.",1
some things are easier in person.,1
i hope writing this post helped you out a bit.,1
maybe its life even-ing up the cards.,1
its stupid and messed up and sucks.,1
"i dont have any advice, but dont trivialise how youre feeling.",1
even if you think you have no reason.,1
i dont think suicide or selfharm is ever really reasonable.,1
one doesnt need a reason to be depressed.,1
its not a choice and just happens.,1
im sorry if this isnt helpful.,1
yeah seems like a suicide note.,1
i hope he didnt go through with it and you get in contact with him.,1
anything you want to talk about?,1
"im sorry youre at this point, and i cant imagine the ache youre in.",1
well throwing up is probably a good thing.,1
"you need to get help though, please call 911.",1
"you can do it, and it will help.",1
"i know its scary and you dont want to go, but like the other person said, you posted here for a reason.",1
how did your appointment with the t go?,1
youre almost to your appointment!,1
youre doing great getting this far.,1
it doesnt make you a pansy to be afraid to kill yourself.,1
fighting through when everything screams for you to do it is very brave and courageous.,1
im glad youre bad at killing yourself :,1
you wouldnt be around talking to me if you werent.,1
"its alright to be nervous, i completely understand.",1
but you can fight through that.,1
you have had some awful things happen.,1
i think its good you came here though.,1
"to put it in perspective, after reading your post, i looked at your karma points:",1
"your post is long, so please forgive mine for being long.",1
"this isnt a hotline, and i know that there isnt much we can say here, but some of us can give our opinions and muscle weakness advice.",1
there isnt much i can tell you.,1
nothing i can say can make your situation easier.,1

"middle school was the worst time in my life, and for most of my peers.",1
"when you grow older people will not yell as much, and people will hardly tease you at all.",1
"even if they do, you will be stronger by then and outside influences will have less of an effect of you.",1
this is a trial for your spirit; stay true to yourself and you will emerge a bona fide woman.,1
"come on man, i got love for you.",1
you need to stay up and stay safe.,1
"really terrible things happen in this life, horrible awful things that arent even proper to speak of, but folk still get on through with a lot of smiles and laughs.",1
"you gotta stay around, and make things better for yourself, and find those smiles again.",1
"you dont care about what people think, but at the same time they influence you greatly.",1
"also, why does not caring this much cause you to feel like a teenager?",1
it seems like not caring about others think would have the opposite effect.,1
depression is obscuring your direction.,1
put yourself in a position to become happy or inspired.,1
what could give you direction?,1
suicide is to terrible to imagine.,1
remember that mental depression is a disease that can be cured; but suicide is a tragedy beyond anything.,1
"that is terrible, i hope things get better for you and your family.",1
"you are not useless, you are a husband and a father who has a sense of responsiblity.",1
that counts for something in my book.,1
what you are experiencing is call suicidal ideation:,1
"org/wiki/suicidal_ideationdont ever believe these are your own thoughts, they are from a small fickle place in your brain.",1
why do you think your mom is anger at you for losing the girl?,1
"dont let these setbacks kill you, literally.",1
"if you want to get into the welding industry you certainly will, just keep sending out those applications.",1
"remember, it will be all worth it in the end; the united states is short tens of thousands of welders, so you should know your skills are valuable .",1
check out r/welding; there is a lot of experienced welders with strong opinions on there that may help you.,1
it has certainly helped me understand the welding trade which i am learning to be a part of.,1
"you will get through this, and it will be alright.",1
just take a second to breath and chill; appreciate that you still have your two legs to bear you and your two hands to build your aspirations.,1
its good to feel good about your weight.,1
"the mental depression diet may not be the best, but hell you gotta look at the good.",1
"with that exercise too, sheesh, i bet youre stunning.",1
i am moved by your post; you have my sympathy and condolences.,1
"this is the right place to post this, its good to get these things out of yourself.",1
"what are some things that you have been passionate about in the past, my friend?",1
"those too are important to get out of yourself, especially if you want to care about them again.",1
things will change for better or for worse.,1
you could look forward to moving with this change.,1
"making friends, improving yourself, and trying new experiences for example.",1
all of these things can come to pass.,1
"certainly, young looking people age the most gracefully - like when polish something nice and slowly.",1
"i must go to bed now, perhaps i will see you in my dreams!",1
i assume people like you because you are a good person.,1
depression has a way of obscuring the way we truly are from ourselves.,1
"you focus on the negative, but the negative is not the whole of reality.",1
there are always thirst spells in the game of love; you must be patient and give these things time.,1
"suicide is such a tragedy, it is the greatest bereavement any group of people can face.",1
im sure that there is someone out there who can help you.,1
"you may not believe it, but im sure many more people then you think will be upset if you were to commit suicide.",1
"thank you, stranger, for all of your help.",1
"and help someone you dont know, and thats hard to find.",1
its like im a different person when im depressed.,1
"i despise the person i feel myself becoming, and then want to end it all.",1
sleeping is sometimes my only reprieve.,1
"then, i have vivid nightmares.",1
dreams like horror movies.,1
"i remember wanting to scream for help, but being gagged.",1
"and, then a dream of being chased but not sure by what.",1
"then, when i hypersomnia, i never want to wake up.",1
my nightmares seem friendlier than real life.,1
"at least the fear is of what is, not what will or may be.",1
"anyway, i really just appreciate you reading my scrambled thoughts.",1
"i was at a very low low, but im feeling much better now.",1
"i guess my work is going great, and my boss is happy with me.",1
"my boyfriend and i seem to be doing well, and i made a new friend at work.",1
"im about to switch from overnights to days in a month, so that should help my sleeping issues and hopefully my spurts of mental depression.",1
"i found a hypothermia, natural hypersomnia aide that apparently assists with mental depression by producing seratonin .",1
"if youre curious, its called 5 htp.",1
"and, while reddit was out, i, unlike a lot of other redditors, exercised for 45 minutes and stayed within my caloric limit.",1
"so, i guess things are going a lot better.",1
"if you ever need help or someone to talk to, please feel free to get ahold of me.",1
"for me, its like the whole world is imploding in my chest.",1
"it takes all of my energy, all of my positivity, and all of my concentration just to keep myself motivated enough to try again.",1
"but, i think its getting a bit easier; each time i go through an episode, the more i realize everyone elses problems are practically the same.",1
"im not criticizing myself as much because i know a lot of other people have been down the same road, the same decisions.",1
"most of the time, i realize this.",1
"but, on occassion, it comes back in force.",1
"so, while every mental depression is unique, i understand.",1
"it really sucks, and im here for you.",1
pm me if you want to talk more about it.,1
no one deserves to fight it alone.,1
you dont have anything you care about?,1
what age did you first experience these symptoms?,1
why do you have the urge to kill these people?,1
what satisfaction is derived from all of this?,1
can you get this satisfaction elsewhere?,1
what mostly concerns me is that youre not really giving any reasons to kill yourself other than you fear killing other people.,1
"it doesnt seem to me you lack empathy--but, rather, you have a strong sense of it.",1
you desire to protect the people around you from getting chest pain by you by killing yourself.,1
"a truly apathetic person would not write this post, nor would they take the time to consider other peoples lives.",1
"additionally, if you were truly apathetic, you wouldnt have self-concern.",1
you wouldnt be worried about going to an asylum.,1
you have emotions and empathy.,1
no matter how much youve tried to lie to yourself.,1
what hole are you trying to fill in?,1
"my argument, therefore, is that you should at least hold off on killing yourself until you have a satisfying answer as to why you should do it.",1
"you should be fully convinced, without a doubt, that you want to die because of this and this and this reason.",1
"you shouldnt need to post on a website about this, you should just do it.",1
"although, dont get me wrong, im not saying you should.",1
im merely saying you should explore as many paths as you can before you kick the bucket.,1
"foremost, you should at least pick apart reasons why youre like this with someone else.",1
"it sounds like youre in a phobia, social slump.",1
i can garantee you that you werent always like this.,1
"if im wrong, then you need to seek out continuous help from a psychiatrist.",1
"however, are there people who love you?",1
you should consider attempting to love them back.,1
"when the destructive urges come, write them out in a novel like what",1
"i love school, but ive had to drop out of it 4 times.",1
"im 22, like yourself, and just finally got my a.",1
i found out along the way that i cannot go full time and work full time.,1
"im too poor to work only part time, but i plan on going back to school in the fall with half the credits.",1
"itll take some time, but ill get where im going.",1
"youre young yet--when the time comes to be a true man or woman, youll rise to the occasion because you have no choice.",1
"i feel irresponsible and lazy a lot, too.",1
"but, in the end, ive pulled through some amazing circumstances like taking care of a very sick mother.",1
"so, if youre really unhappy with yourself as a human being, get a part time job.",1
ease your way into working while you can.,1
"give him chocolate, you cant kill yourself if you eat chocolate.",1
"according to my psych lecturer its true, because of chemistry and stuff.",1
honestly im a strange person filled with hate and love and i have very strong opinions about many things.,1
but the thought of anyone committing suicide saddens me greatly.,1
for example- and im not suggesting you do this- i once read a very inspirational story about a homeless guy who deliberately committed an offence and got caught.,1
while he was in jail he used the time to better himself by completing a degree and lined himself up a job for when he got out.,1
theres always another way around a situation.,1
"if you ever feel like someone to talk to, pm me.",1
"just think of something positive that makes sedated state and happy, like a beach or a gentle breeze.",1
"whenever you start panicking, just remember that youre in control of your situation and you can get through it.",1
"always, always breathe deep and think calmly.",1
try to focus on something positive.,1
"i know you dont like living with family, but dont let him control your life.",1
you have friends here to help you :,1
you still have a life ahead of you.,1
"life is horrible, but you gotta grab it and open the doors.",1
"my ex-gf basically ignored md, and we had been together for 7 months.",1
"i felt horrible, like those 7 months ultimately meant nothing.",1
"i know its very hard, but ending it is not the way to fix things.",1
"its not a problem, thats what we are here for.",1
lots of people need a hug or just someone to talk to :,1
i feel as though you will do well :,1
"please be careful and remember, a sedated state mind.",1
ive been emotionally attached to someone younger than me  ive never looked at child pornography and havent downloaded any.,1
but the reason i do not act on those thoughts is because i honestly care for her.,1
not being able to see her smile and knowing that i caused her suffering.,1
the thought of it makes me deeply sad.,1
"i can say you are on the right track to helping yourself, not by saying youre a freak, but by admitting that you do have an issue and it needs to be taken care of.",1
im sure the link below could have helped.,1
understand that you arent alone.,1
there are people here that are willing to help you in any way they can.,1
"a lot of great people had it, like einstein :",1
"i have a friend who has it, and it took a while for him to gain his phobia, social confidence, but he did.",1
"i cant gibe you therapy professionally, but i want you to know i am herhere :",1
"if you feel down again, you can talk to me anytime ya want :",1
im glad that youre feeling better :,1
i understand what youre going through.,1
"im 24, and my mother didnt exactly make the best choices , and my sis took care of me since i was 8, and then i legally loved with my grandma until 18, when i legally became an adult.",1
i have a depressed mood job in terms of making money.,1
"my grandma treats me like a child, says i dont know anything and such, it really annoys me.",1
there were/are days when i ask myself why i wake up.,1
doing the same things everyday.,1
"ive drank myself to hypersomnia once, and it was horrible.",1
ive had a set of friends ive known forever.,1
they helped me slowly gain confidence.,1
"i know we dont know each other, but i want to help you in any way i can.",1
i work at a suicide hotline and have had to call rescue many times for people and advised even more like yourself to contact the authorities in very similar situations.,1
"depending on your location the responders and procedures may vary a little but in texas when we contact the police for a welfare check they will respond within 10-20 minutes, what they walk in on greatly depends on the reactions.",1
"also, sometimes it isnt just the police, sometimes mental health professionals and the ambulance come along as well.",1
if they feel she needs help they will transport her to the hospital.,1
if not they will do their best to alert a family member/roommate of the situation and advise her to seek out help if she feels she needs it.,1
"they are not there to bust someone for anything, that is not to say they wont.",1
"but the thing is, death is a much longer sentence than any unregistered gun charge.",1
you could also call some local psychiatric hospitals to see if they have any welfare check programs and alert someone else of your concerns.,1
"does she live with her parents, boyfriend, roommate?",1
id see if you could get her to at least talk to someone.,1
do not say they need help to get better because they do understand that that takes months-years.,1
"just ask them to meet with someone once, make one phone call.",1
"give her the numbers to your local hotlines, you dont have to pressure her to call but just so she has them.",1
she may reach out for help on her own.,1
"and most importantly, make sure you are ok.",1
if you need help or support of any kind find someone to lean on.,1
you have so many possibilities ahead of you.,1
"you got into med school, thats a whole lot more than most people can accomplish.",1
its going to be hard to finish school; i did not go to med school so i am not sure what the options are but you can do it.,1
"you may have to get creative or re-structure your life, and you may have to sacrifice sleep/social life etc to finish.",1
but that is the life of a grad student.,1
if medicine is something you are passionate about you just need to find a way to rekindle that passion and youll get a second wind.,1
as for the girl situation; if she broke up with you over your penis size then good riddance; you dont want her.,1
even if you are not well endowed there are plenty of other ways to sexually satisfy someone and plenty of men who are unlucky in that department who are happily in a relationship.,1
"take it from a girl, if you hone your other talents you can make her forget about your size.",1
"youre in med school, you sound very intelligent, honest, and self-aware.",1
grad/med school school and your early twenties is a transitional period for everyone in one way or another.,1
"i promise you, that is so young.",1
"you will look back on this in july of 2013 and hardly recognize yourself, and you will do that again and again.",1
some years you may miss the previous you and others you may be elated you made it through that year.,1
"as for your looks/social skills, non of that is permanent that can all be fixed if it is really as bad as you say, but often times we are our own worst critics.",1
"nonetheless if someone is threatening suicide and youve exhaustion all other options, i would still alert the authorities.",1
"heh, therapists deal with a lot of patients like that and are probably very used to it.",1
"my advice would be to schedule one and tell them just that, see what they say they can offer you.",1
what is it you are hoping to gain from a psychologist?,1
i know at my center we all answer the calls a bit differently; you can always try back until you get a greeting you feel gives you a comfortable opening.,1
"me personally, i do what you want and usually say .",1
or something along those lines.,1
"my suggestion though is no matter what they say, just say .",1
"we get every single kind of greeting you can imagine, like crying, sedated state and cheery, violent cussing, drunk slurring etc.",1
"saying  is all you need to make that first connection, from there they should most definitely ask how you are or why you are calling.",1
dont feel bad if you feel like you have to try multiple times.,1
"depending on the hotline, odds are the counselor wont even know it.",1
i have some callers that love to talk to me and hate to talk to some of my co-workers and will keep calling until they get someone they like.,1
just different styles and comfort levels.,1
"i do the same thing with phone calls, i almost always write a script of at least the bullet points i want to hit.",1
"maybe try that; if you can think of things bothering you and list them, even if its something silly that is just bothering you today that will at least give you something to go off of.",1
"or be honest, say youve never called before and you dont know how it works.",1
that happens a lot more than you think.,1
"its scary reaching out for help, and i completely feel for you, just be patient, keep the #s handy and when you need to, call, then if you dont feel comfortable, hang up.",1
"no big deal, you can always try again later.",1
"we get some frustrating calls some days  i know i would love to be able to talk to someone like you and help you however i could, even if its just listening for a few minutes.",1
my most common starts to the call are:,1
or they just jump right into why they called barely giving me a chance to say my name.,1
there is no right or wrong way.,1
you could suggest they try to find a local survivors of suicide support group if they want something more personal and on going.,1
"im a crisis counselor and this is, in my opinion, bad advice.",1
"if a person needs psychological help, often times there is no other way to get them the help they need then by forcing them into a 72 hours psych hold, and the only way to do that if they are an adult and have not committed any crimes is to involve the police.",1
the first thing we tell someone who is calling about a suicidal friend is to take care of themselves first.,1
"you dont want to put yourself in harms way, or in a situation where you arent comfortable, could potentially witness something traumatic or harm a friendship.",1
"no one likes the police, but most cities are pretty good about understanding suicidal threats  they are trained in crisis management, something op, to the best of my knowledge, is not trained in.",1
it is unfair to ask a friend and even a relative to intervene in some situations and in most of those situations they could be the worst person in terms of what her friend needs.,1
"the police absolutely are there for that, thats exactly why they are trained and have specific programs for these situations.",1
"right, but they cannot commit someone for that, and op  would need to have reported her for possessing one.",1
"i meant more along the lines of drug use, violence, drunk driving, and so on.",1
dont ever feel like you shouldnt feel one way because someone else has it  than you.,1
"there doesnt have to be, if nothing can be pinpointed then they can still help.",1
"i spent most of my therapy just going over my weeks, good and bad and discussing relationships.",1
sometimes they can help you figure out a  if there is one.,1
or just help you with the ambiguity.,1
ive had a therapist most of my life and i just completed my bs in psych pursuing grad school next.,1
"for me and my depression, my psychologist literally saved my life more times than i can count.",1
each experience is a bit different and it depends on the type of psychology they practice but i have only had one bad experience with a psychologist in 25 years and they were court appointed.,1
"i would call them and ask about your insurance, they can tell you how much is covered and so on.",1
as far as what to expect; in my experience the first meeting will be just a general get to know you sort of session.,1
they will ask about your life as well as any specific reasons you came to see them.,1
its hard to say how a specific therapy session would go without knowing what type of psychologist they are but my best guess would be that you would meet weekly/biweekly/monthly  where they would ask you various questions or you could just openly talk.,1
they would give you tools and advice to try and apply in your life.,1
"and what was always most important to me, offer someone who is in no way involved in your life, they dont have a stake either way and they are there is validate and support you.",1
"id bet something went wrong with the 67, if a # is blocked there is no way for us to unblock it.",1
"believe me, there are times we definitely wish we could to save someones life.",1
"again, its my opinion the counselor shouldnt have called back, it is not 1-800 suicides policy by any means to do that.",1
"but, sometimes a counselor might feel its needed.",1
i would disagree with them wholeheartedly.,1
"as i said, the job requires that we understand what is and is not within our control and sometimes people have a lot of trouble with that.",1
"some people are upset when we ask if we can call the police, or actually do it.",1
but you need to understand what our services are for; we are there to talk and help you through things but we are not going to sit on the phone and listen to you kill/chest pain yourself.,1
"we are legally required to call the police if the situation merits it, and at my center its our policy that if a call is terminated and we believe the person is in real danger that we call the authorities immediately, we never call back the caller unless they contracted with us to do so.",1
"im sorry that your friend doesnt trust them anymore, hotlines can be a great resource for some people, but it sounds like he doesnt want the help we can offer.",1
"we have very limited resources, we cannot spend an hour with each caller and we cannot be a voice to listen to while you harm yourself, nor can we contact a friend or family member about the situation.",1
its good that he sought out a professional counselor as they have many more resources and availability to work with him and i hope he is doing better.,1
i am a call counselor for nspl as well as various local hotlines.,1
"i understand its really hard to make that call, but we really are there to listen, and we allow you to guide the conversation.",1
"we arent going to dig into anything you dont want to discuss, if you just want to call for referrals thats what well give you.",1
if you are lonely and just need someone to talk to well give you 15 minutes to just shoot the shit.,1
what is it that makes you nervous?,1
i assure you its 100% anonymous and we honestly wont judge you.,1
im also here to talk if you need to.,1
i work for a hotline and 1-800-suicide is one of the lines we answer.,1
"yes, we have caller id, but there are easy ways to block it that actually do work.",1
"as far as getting called back, the protocol for that varies greatly from counselor to counselor.",1
"if we believe the person is actually in the process of harming themselves, we are required by law to report it.",1
"now, for an unsettling call, its hard to say.",1
"the training at my center as well as my personal beliefs are that they need to agree to a follow up call  these are set up in advance and we will call back 1 hour, 2 hour, 24 hours etc etc.",1
"its my personal opinion that if you just werent getting what you needed, were still upset, didnt promise to not chest pain yourself and the counselor called you back because they just wanted a  then they were overstepping their role, big time.",1
"i have gotten those calls where the person either hung up or was still distraught when we terminated the call, and they suck.",1
"you end up thinking about that person for a few days hoping they are ok, but thats one of the downsides of the job.",1
"i dont call them back if they terminated the call, obviously what i was offering wasnt working for them, im not going to force it down their throats.",1
especially since all us counselors have different counseling styles.,1
we have a lot of callers call numerous times trying to find a counselor that can offer what they need/want.,1
"we arent going off a script, please if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to dont let one stupid, counselor on a power trip trying to assuage their own guilt stop you from reaching out.",1
i promise you there are those of us who can be helpful and respectful.,1
im sorry if that counselor made you uncomfortable.,1
"just know that that sounds like an edge case to me, and im tempted to tell you to report them, if you got their name we can track it to whomever was working the shift, no matter where their center is located.",1
im here to talk if you need it.,1
"it depends on your carrier, just call them and ask how 1-800 #s show up on their bills.",1
"for us, the # appears but it doesnt say .",1
"as everyone else said, there are numerous online services as well, and most crisis lines also have chat services now.",1
"im a crisis counselor and a lot of people wonder the same thing, will it ever end?",1
"i, too, battled major mental depression disorder and suicidal thoughts throughout my adolescence and then again in my early twenties.",1
"the biggest difference i noticed the second time around, once i acknowledged my mental depression was back and started taking steps to get better was that i had history that said i could do it.",1
"i had pulled myself out of it when i was 18 and i found happiness; yes, my mental depression did return but i was already ahead of the game and i had a lot of tools to help me cope better the second time around.",1
"i always tell the teenagers that i counsel that its especially hard when you are depressed mood and a teenager because you havent yet seen how drastically life can change, how much you will change.",1
my drug abuse school self wouldnt even recognize my college self.,1
"you are lucky in that you are 17, if you go to university or not; your life will go through so many changes in the next few years, you wont even believe it.",1
you just need to prepare for the changes.,1
"if you want to go to university, then do everything you can to get there.",1
im not saying she doesnt matter as a person.,1
"i just see a lot of kids with the fml attitude, and over what?",1
"really, an ipod that will be out of date in a few years and your whole life is ruined.",1
"i saw money issues as a problem, but honestly those are her parents concern.",1
dont take on problems that are not yours.,1
dont measure yourself against other people.,1
there will always be someone better.,1
"measure yourself against who you were yesterday, and you may not always win, but you will get better.",1
"and finally, i was saying find a better mentor to hang around than her parents.",1
"teacher, coach, who knows  but learn about life from people that are successful at it, or something, anything.",1
im an atheist that doesnt fit in too.,1
"cynical, single, i think i understand your pain.",1
"it may suck, but i guess i look at it as faking it and following blindly, being someone you are not, would be wayyyyy worse than being you.",1
"i think you also have to think about that its still winter, and some people get seasonal effective disorder from lack of sun.",1
"it puts extra pressure on everyone, not just the single people.",1
with them i get so much more done.,1
its not just the caffeine that helps.,1
even if you steal your buddies gun and go out into the woods someone is going to find the body eventually.,1
"there is a party going on but instead of connecting with people, you are alone thinking of killing yourself because you dont connect with people.",1
things have always been easy for you in life.,1
making friends is not always easy.,1
"dont crying reflex, abnormal about it if you dont get what you want.",1
"if you arent making new friends at the party, try a new circle of friends and start over.",1
"i dont know what you look like anything else about you, but try putting effort into your appearance and hygiene.",1
when meeting new people dont talk about depressing shit like this.,1
"then go out and do something social, even if you dont like it.",1
be in a joyful state about how much you hate it.,1
"you dont have to do it again, but you really just need to try.",1
like 80 cents each.,1
"you might not need a membership if they are classified as pharmacy, otherwise find a buddy with a membership and stock up.",1
"not sure i can offer much help, but you have self esteem issues.",1
"a long time ago i was in the car with my dad listening to npr, and dr laura was on.",1
she was talking about self esteem and how it really is just that.,1
its the esteem you give your self.,1
it doesnt come from other people.,1
if you cant work and they wont declare you disabled  you got have a problem.,1
if you figure out how to make it through life without a job let me know.,1
"you sound out of control, or your life at least.",1
i think you have to love yourself more than anything before others can love you.,1
"if weight is a problem, you really have to ask yourself which do you love more food or not being over weight.",1
take some time to walk or bike or some activity you enjoy.,1
"it will come eventual, be patient.",1
you need to find something that makes you feel good about you and stop looking for it from other people.,1
and exercise might help you feel better emotionally.,1
i had friends that were really good people in drug abuse school.,1
i never understood why people would hangout with other people that treat them like shit.,1
its just the world because years later i really dont have close friends now.,1
you still might find one or two though.,1
"yeah you think the grass is greener, but going to big schools = big school loans.",1
"although, degree does not equal drug abuse paying job.",1
community colleges are not bad choices.,1
"if you are the straight a student, dont anxiety about not having a job.",1
"if not, then you could be working a job building experience and then using that degree to qualify you for a promotion in a company where people already know you.",1
i cant really comment sexuality thing.,1
"personally, i dont anxiety about telling people my sexual preference.",1
you feel like you have something to hide.,1
i really dont see why people need to know.,1
i think a lot of people make it their identity.,1
"if you are with a person to standout, you are not really with that person.",1
"then again on second thought, just say you are gay then you can play the gay card pretty much anywhere and have things handed to you.",1
i agree with stuckey3 that its partly and esteem issue.,1
"its self esteem, not the esteem everyone else gives you.",1
you just need more aspects to you life than school and sexuality preference so when 1 falls you have something else to feel good about.,1
"im saying dont put so much pressure on yourself, because of all things in my life personally, i cant attribute any of them to anything that happened when i was 13.",1
"im 34 and i will trade you my life for your straight up, car bank account, age, ect.",1
nothing matters when you are 13.,1
you can fail school and you know what happens?,1
you get to do it all over again.,1
"seriously even if you get kicked out of school you can still find a job, a so, some place to live, and just have a life in general .",1
"actually, i think your problem is your parents.",1
"they have bad habits that cause problems instead of prevent them, they freak out about them, and over the years you have learned to freak out about them mimicking your parents.",1
your mental depression and anxiety mental depression is a learned behavior when it comes down to it.,1
"you could medicate it, but can you medicate a learned behavior?",1
"you need to spend time with people that have good habits, and learn that shit.",1
"if you have money, look nice, and can hold down a conversation.",1
"seriously, the customer is always right.",1
"if you are not sure, just ask the girl, she will tell you.",1
"its a temporary fix, but think of it as training wheels for the real thing.",1
"and if you do do this and get to know a few of the girls, bring cheese cake for the girls.",1
"please dont, i care and im sure someone  cares for you as well.",1
"not intentionally, was trying to write something meaningful.",1
"it seems unimaginably horrible, please dont blame yourself.",1
i havent come across anything similar before in my life so im no expert but perseverance is vital and keeping your mind focused on something would surely help.,1
"you mention that youre a strong guy, would it help if you did something like weight-lifting or abnormal dreams gym sessions to relieve stress?",1
its healthy to grieve but eventually moving on will also be important.,1
its unclear from the post if youre feeling suicidal but if so:,1
"well thats very good, i wish you all the best with whats to come in the future for you :",1
"i depends on a lot of factors, and the answer is different for everyone.",1
"for me, the best is probably not the easiest.",1
"the easiest in my mind would be brett michaels, what with his wanton lifestyle and his _rock of love_ debauchery.",1
"he seems to be the most grounded of the whole lot, and seems to be perfecting his art and talent while the others are just living off of their past fame.",1
"hopefully, you are going to call 911, they are going to call poison control, who will advise you what to do to stay alive.",1
there are some things worse than death when mixing medicines at drug abuse doses.,1
would you like to talk about that with me?,1
"it may seem that way, but we humans are very fickle.",1
"sometimes i feel like im all alone, sometimes i recognize all the love that is around me.",1
there are good days and bad days.,1
"dont make this very big, very permanent decision on a bad day, month, year, or even decade.",1
"you dont know what is in your future, but you can overcome this.",1
"if you dont think you have the strength, look elsewhere for your strength:",1
"other people, books, faith, therapy.",1
"sometimes i want to throw in the towel, that doesnt make it the right decision for my future.",1
there are other things to live for.,1
"if i could say something to make it all better, i would.",1
maybe i can point you in a direction youve missed.,1
"i know what filled mine, but i hesitate to share it.",1
im sure your track record will improve .,1
and its probably not as bad as you think.,1
"i think if you ate some healthy, real meals and got some good sleep, you might be in a better frame of mind to think about how to move forward.",1
what about helping your family?,1
have you ever talked to a professional about anxiety mental depression and mental depression?,1
"i personally believe those drugs are prescribed too often, but there are some definite medical reasons that can lead to those symptoms.",1
it just looks like it sometimes.,1
could you apologize to those ppl?,1
i dont feel that killing yourself is the best decision and i dont feel that any plans to kill oneself are great.,1
"your existence can benefit others, and im sure it does.",1
smiling to others at the grocery store is a benefit to the world.,1
have you sought out any other counselors or psychologists?,1
have u had any further conversations?,1
who else can you talk to about what ur going through?,1
i dont think anyone can be replaced.,1
"life would go on without you, but you cannot be replaced.",1
something is missing in your life.,1
"apparently, you have been trying to fill it with things that dont  what else could you try?",1
"ive been replying to the op, but i think our conversation is best served in another subreddit.",1
hit me up over in r/debateachristian.,1
"yeah, unfortunately, that happens.",1
"regardless, with a mom and a boyfriend, people love you.",1
you have a lot to live for and a lot of time to do it.,1
dont make any big decisions when you are emotionally upset.,1
can you go to school or get a better job?,1
it sounds like u are in a tough spot.,1
you might talk a bit to your parents and not go into all the details.,1
maybe tell them you are having a hard time with friends just so the people who love you know you are struggling a bit.,1
"as far as the other friend who cares a lot about herself, all people have issues.",1
"she might be dealing with somethin she isnt telling you about, or she might just be selfish.",1
"ate there any other people you know and respect, people who are confident and grounded that you can talk to or start a friendship with?",1
"reaching out here is a good step, but face to face conversation is always better.",1
"or go to mcdonalds, get a $1 burger and load up on free napkins?",1
"i know these sound weird, but they do solve the temporary problems.",1
"more importantly for the future, are you in the right job?",1
do you have a fuel efficient car?,1
is your rent payment too much?,1
i hope you didnt really just do that.,1
is your username regarding this post or your entire existence?,1
"yes, that can make life difficult.",1
do you have anyone else you can talk to?,1
"if you ask 10 people, you will get 11 contradictory answers.",1
"my answer, love god, love others.",1
what did you think before this?,1
im surprised your friends dont like to talk about their beliefs.,1
maybe they just dont like to talk to you.,1
i know that atheist posts on reddit with the highest upvotes usually reference  because it seems to be the most noble reason to not believe .,1
"notwithstanding, having spent a lifetime talking to people about their faith or lack thereof, the atheists i talk to hardly ever mention it.",1
"they usually say something like    or  but regarding your wait on the evidence, i would submit that the burden of proof necessary to make you believe on christ and submit to his will is impossible.",1
"ultimately, some people will never swallow their pride and humble themselves to believe that they need christ to atone for their sin.",1
well then you definitely have a lot of living to do.,1
"again, dont care about what other people think about you.",1
"if you are unhappy with your choices, make different choices.",1
you have plenty of time to change.,1
"also, you havent failed as a man.",1
"or rather, we have all failed at something.",1
"i think if you have a list of all the people who can vouch for you, you can then submit a settlement  which i believe is required by law to be presented to the other family by their lawyer.",1
"well, since you asked, because i am a christian.",1
"therefore, i do not believe i am defined by my happiness, sorrow, wealth, poverty, wisdom, talents, etc.",1
"i also do not believe my life will get better; it may get much, much worse, and that is okay.",1
it gets better and it gets worse.,1
one of the ways to accomplish this is to love and serve others.,1
i know people who post to r/suicidewatch need love  so i post here.,1
"i believe that after i die, since i believe in jesus, i will go to heaven, where i will be rewarded for loving and serving others.",1
i have hope today and i have hope for the future.,1
i was looking through your post history and found it.,1
my point was was suicide is like that slide.,1
you can return the slide but you cant come back to life.,1
please dont make an irreversible decision.,1
do you still have buddies in ohio?,1
i think you would be the victim of that crime.,1
"you might end up in prison, or worse, handicapped and in prison, with no freedom to choose how you live your life.",1
keep looking for a job and then maybe look for other people less fortunate than you to see if you can help them at all.,1
what can you be doing to make it right?,1
what can you do to love her and your son today?,1
"ive definitely studied judaism, islam, and a the derivatives of those and christianity.",1
ive looked at buddhism and hinduism a little but not very deep.,1
i feel like eating rice and oatmeal will be bad for your health.,1
is there any other way you can see to decrease the stresses in your life and your wifes life?,1
"i thought during bankruptcy, you were protected in your place of residence?",1
"now, im not suggesting it, but i was hoping the medical bills could be pushed back if you threatened the collectors that if they pressed on you any more, they would get nothing.",1
she is definitely not responsible.,1
"but if she did talk to the cops, it could help them find the bad guy, and i hope that would help the victim.",1
"it would not be ideal, and there are things that are worse than death, like being pinned to a tree inside a mangled car for 3 days.",1
please tell me more about your life.,1
"what about your plans to go to new zealand, volunteering at a zoo, and biking around the united states?",1
"people who are hurting, do things and say things they shouldnt.",1
you might want to take the drug abuse ground at these opportunities and give them the benefit of the doubt.,1
can you get medicaid or food assistance?,1
how bad can they come after you?,1
"eventually, you could just go bankrupt and they cant collect anything so there are limits to what lengths they can go.",1
can you still go to the job you had lined up?,1
life is hard and it definitely isnt fair.,1
"for every person with a so, there are a bunch without.",1
would you consider your life a failure?,1
"maybe you dont have a so, but do you a have family and friends?",1
"last, you mentioned a bunch of physical things you have tried to fill that hole.",1
what about philosophy or faith?,1
you have a lot of living and loving to do before you pass away.,1
"dont hate yourself, and dont place much weight in what other people think about you.",1
"the key is not to think  but to think,",1
"i work with kids on occasion and it is a shame that anytime a kid says something, its guilty until proven innocent.",1
"there are definitely some bad guys out there but for petes sake, you are a swim coach.",1
you are going to have to change eventually.,1
i really hope your lawyer understands this.,1
there are some unbelievable clips on youtube of care workers interrogating young children until they said anything the care workers wanted to hear:,1
"getting raped by toys and scissors and crap like that, with zero injuries.",1
"one thing i might do is have you or your lawyer talk to every other kid, parent, helper on the swim team to see if any of them have ever seen you act inappropriately to any kid and anytime.",1
and who was your mom pregnant with?,1
"when you say , are you talking about just the last two weeks?",1
"because if so, i would say, the last two weeks definitely sucked, but it probably doesnt define the direction of your life.",1
is there anyone that could be positively impacted by your life?,1
"today, tomorrow, or in the next 30 years you will have lots of time to positively impact others.",1
thats worth living for right there.,1
what do you do on your day off?,1
"once i got mw3 for christmas, i havent picked up bf3, and i probably wont.",1
"less realistic maybe, but good for hours of fun.",1
do you live with your parents or on your own?,1
net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/380736_265933376834371_100002531324041_595629_571231638_n.,1
"jpgi guess sometimes you think you know what you want, but when you get it, you change your mind.",1
dont make any decisions right now that you cant reverse.,1
it will definitely improve with some positive changes from you.,1
what can you do for someone in the next hour that would be nice?,1
and i still think its probably not as bad as you think.,1
"you still have a girlfriend, so thats something.",1
"the futon is no fun, but im talking about uninterrupted sleep.",1
"still, it seems like the cons outweigh the pros.",1
i know new jobs are hard tom come by but you might want to be looking for other options.,1
i dont think ive ever really struggled with mental depression.,1
i believe god has a plan for my life:,1
for me to love him and love others.,1
"sometimes its great, other times it sucks.",1
"but ultimately, its his plan and i trust in him.",1
"if the pay sucks and you cant move up, it might be time to move on.",1
have you talked to your boss about what it would take to move up?,1
"while my faith does bring me comfort, the comfort is only an effect, not the cause.",1
but saying all your friends believe only for the comfort it brings is like saying all atheists refuse to believe because they just want to live a life full of sin.,1
people believe and refuse to believe for different reasons.,1
"personally, i became a believer at around 5 years old mainly to go to heaven.",1
"lets face it, some things are more clear to a child than an adult anyway.",1
"ask a 5 year old if its wrong to tell a lie, then go ask a lawyer.",1
"im a believer now because i believe the bible is gods word, and christ is the only one who can pay for my sin.",1
why cant you talk to your parents about it?,1
"they may not be happy, but its done, its in the past.",1
who else can you talk with about it?,1
have you explored that gift much?,1
do you write a blog or journal?,1
"is there anything you can do to change things up, to change from the repetition?",1
its never too late to make changes in your life.,1
"i your friend has problems too, then you need each other.",1
help her and get help from her.,1
"if you need more help, keep looking.",1
suicide is not the only way out.,1
"think about it like this, someone took advantage of you, and they think they have control.",1
"the way to take back control is to face your issues, not to run away.",1
maybe no one talks to each other in your neighborhood because no one is talking to them.,1
"i hear what you are saying, but i want to make an important distinction.",1
"true, taking your own life takes some resolve, but many would say its ultimately running from the problem, or just quitting.",1
"when i think about someone ready to kill himself/herself, i think of someone who is not afraid of death.",1
now someone who is not afraid of death .,1
they can definitely be capable of some ballsy things.,1
im thinking what could a ballsy person do to make the world a better place if he/she was not afraid of death?,1
"help people with skin diseases, infectious diseases, spend time helping the needy in areas of increased crime, volunteer at time when others wont.",1
"i know there maybe other dangers involved in those activities, but the idea of not being afraid of death should really expand the list of things you are willing to do.",1
maybe just knock on a random door in your neighborhood and invite someone out to coffee?,1
maybe people around you are struggling too?,1
if you had money do you think most of your problems would be gone?,1
ive done some budget counseling in the past.,1
maybe we can find some extra cash in your budget so you can make some changes in other areas?,1
you have a boyfriend and it sounds like a sister who loves you and wants the best for you.,1
"its possible that your sister and your boyfriend will never get along, but dont lose hope because they dont.",1
you are strong enough to deal with this.,1
talk to the people who care about you.,1
dont give up because things arent perfect every day.,1
"i would be lying if i said i knew what you were going through, but i dont.",1
what i do know is that i was taught a very important lesson on beauty as a teenager:,1
outward beauty is fleeting and meaningless.,1
"now most people dont live their lives based in this knowledge but if they live long enough, they will all have to come to grips with it.",1
"the longer they are beautiful on the outside, the worse the lesson will be.",1
i just want to check it out for you.,1
are you still friends with your ex?,1
do you think it is possible to be friends with people of different opinions and morals?,1
you have been surrounded by people who are not true friends.,1
your trust issues are because of this.,1
"when you find some real friends, who love you for who you are, you will probably know it.",1
"you are more than a job, a computer, and a minecraft friendship.",1
"im not trying to belittle the friendship but, there are definitely better friends out there.",1
have you been kicked out of the house before?,1
do you have any other friends who are close?,1
what ones do you like?,1
is there anytime if your life when you were happy?,1
my friend just killed himself.,1
please tell others how you are feeling.,1
im really looking forward to watching her grow up.,1
its like that song not .,1
"ok, so youre 25 with about $24k in debt, and some big monthly bills.",1
i see a lot of hope in that situation.,1
"i know its tough finding jobs but it might make some sense for you to look around anyway, especially if you can only afford living with your parents.",1
"op, im not a doctor either, but if your mother has struggled with mental depression, i think the chances you will struggle with something similar is pretty big.",1
my family has a history of heart disease .,1
everyone struggles with something.,1
that is another sad fact of life.,1
everyone struggles with something.,1
"some people struggle with bigger things, some people deal with it better or worse, but everyone is dealing with how life isnt perfect.",1
you are not alone in your feelings.,1
"and i will die knowing i will not fully understand god, but its okay but because i would rather die not knowing than to delude myself into thinking we are here by chance.",1
"accepting that people are in hell is the reason i am up a night, concerned for others.",1
"guess what, there are some sucky things in life.",1
that doesnt mean mood it isnt true.,1
i definitely dont want to stop this debate.,1
"you posted looking for answers from people, and i believe the bible has the answers you are looking for.",1
"whereas, if i believe that god is in control, then he has a plan for me, so i dont need family, friends, a job, happiness, or health to be reasons to keep going.",1
i keep going because god is in control and he has a plan for my life while i am alive:,1
"this life is not about me, it is about others.",1
think about the bible as the philosophical grand unified theory that everyone is looking for:,1
are you just unhappy with your entire life or a few circumstances?,1
why not be honest with the doctors?,1
maybe there is a physical reason you are not happy.,1
have you ever considered joining a support it religious group?,1
"ever tried to read some self help books, poetry, the bible?",1
i meant support or religious group.,1
"so basically, just any type of group to get together for a purpose, support, helping the poor, photography, etc.",1
"feel free to let us know how it goes, but feel free to keep it private to.",1
"it happens to businesses every day, and its really not that bad.",1
its actually a great way to encourage people to be starting businesses.,1
"if things go bad, you can declare bankruptcy and it limits the damage creditors can do to you.",1
its not like they are going to throw you in jail.,1
"creditors line up, try hard to get what little $$ is ventricular dysfunction, left and eventually, they all realize there isnt any and they go away.",1
"as far as family life, my wife and son and i have been through some tight times financially, including a foreclosure.",1
"its not fun, but life goes on.",1
"you learn to live with less, you learn to make a few sacrifices, and then you realize how great life can be without all the extra stuff we think we need.",1
you are more than your business.,1
look over at the guidelines philosophical discussion about suicide belongs in /r/philosophy or /r/suicidology.,1
"if you start this thread over in one of those places, ill try to find it.",1
"read what other ppl are saying, this is going to chest pain you a lot with vomiting and organ damage when you survive this.",1
the body doesnt want to die and we dont want you to die either.,1
"please call 911, and the come back here to tell us whats going on.",1
"well, what about a counter suit?",1
what does your lawyer think about that?,1
"im not an expert on budgets, but i do know that a lot of medical places wont com after you too hard as long as you are paying something, like $1 every month.",1
"you are worth much, much more alive.",1
"even from a purely mathematical standpoint, the present value of all of your future earnings is huge.",1
"once you attention deficit disorder in the emotional support, love, and charity that you can offer others for the next few decades, it really starts to attention deficit disorder up.",1
im really glad you shared this.,1
suicide isnt a one-person story.,1
"a person may end their own personal narrative when they die, but that doesnt mean mood that person doesnt continue to have an effect on the lives of others.",1
youre just sharing your own personal experience with suicide and how its impacted your life.,1
"i dont know if there are any subs for people who have lost loved ones to suicide, but there really ought to be.",1
i know there are support groups in the real world.,1
"you probably already know this, at least logically, but whatever your ex chose to do wasnt your fault.",1
"say it again,  suicide is such an intensely personal decision.",1
its arguably one of the most personal decisions a person can make.,1
thanks again for sharing your story.,1
"try to be mindful that a lot of people, and probably most people, dont understand what its like to feel suicidal.",1
"when you tell them that youre feeling suicidal, they immediately think of you dying and then they think about how much your death would would chest pain them.",1
thats where that statement to  or  comes from.,1
"its inartful, and its essentially selfish, but its basically meant to convey the idea that people care about you and care about whether you live or die.",1
"if you died, whatever the method, people would feel chest pain.",1
"that being said, i doubt that its ever enough to keep anyone on this planet.",1
youre not wrong for feeling frustrated with this notion.,1
but it also sounds like you might benefit from talking to people who actually understand the weight and depth of the hopelessness youre feeling.,1
it may be hard right now to see this for what it truly is:,1
im sure you spent a lot of time and energy trying to keep this relationship together as you struggled with your mental depression.,1
"he was never worth your time, and now you know it.",1
you dont have to waste any more time on this person who was never worth it in the first place.,1
"now that you know who he truly is, you dont have to waste any more effort investing in a lie.",1
"you have the chance to focus on you, and invest in someone who is worth your energy:",1
"i cant tell you whether your life is worth living, or whether suicide is objectively  i dont purport to have any answers to larger esoteric questions like those.",1
"but i do know that if you commit suicide, it will be devastating for your family and friends on a scale that you cant even begin to imagine.",1
"again, im not saying suicide is right or wrong, and maybe your loved ones are selfish for wanting you to live.",1
"but, none of that changes the fact that your loved ones will never forget, ever, and they will never get over it, ever.",1
they will live with the ache of your suicide until they themselves are finally dead.,1
"its not my quote, but i read a book that made a great analogy.",1
"if you want to commit suicide, then go ahead and gather all the people you know and love around you, as close as you possibly can, and then set off a grenade.",1
youll die and everyone else will survive.,1
"if you ever wanted to do something worthwhile, spare your loved ones from that fate.",1
"they may never know what you did for them, but you will, and thats something to feel pretty damn good about.",1
and i promise you that you will die.,1
you dont need to accelerate one of the few things that is guaranteed in life.,1
at least wait until your mom passes.,1
"you only want her to die because somewhere inside you realize that if you killed yourself, it would absolutely demolish her as a human being, and you dont want to be responsible for that.",1
i think this is a fairly common feeling for people whove been depressed mood for any period of time.,1
im so glad that you are so open to this notion.,1
sometimes it can take a while for a person to understand that uncovering cheating is a genuine blessing.,1
just know that you are not alone in your experience.,1
there are so many good people who have been through something similar and they survived it and absolutely empathize with you.,1
we all live and hopefully we all get to learn.,1
it can be a great learning experience to see where we made mistakes and then figure out how were going to do it differently and treat ourselves better the next time around.,1
"anytime youre in a relationship where your partner is cheating on you, there is an element of abuse- abuse of trust, abuse of power, abuse of information, abuse of emotions, etc.",1
"i dont doubt for a second that this relationship was absolutely draining for you, and the last thing you need when youre dealing with mental depression is a lying, cheating, abusive partner.",1
dont give this guy another ounce of your energy.,1
"now you can see him for who he truly is, which is someone who isnt worth your time.",1
"you are the best thing that ever happened to you, and now you can focus all your energy on getting better and being better.",1
im cheering you on from across the internet!,1
i wouldnt doubt that a lot of depressed mood people use reddit for that purpose .,1
its incredibly frustrating to hear these types of things.,1
"try to remember that people usually mean mood well when they say these things, but they most likely dont understand what youre going through or the type of disease that youre dealing with.",1
it doesnt mean mood that they dont care about you.,1
it usually means that they dont understand how to best care for you.,1
"it comes from a good place, but it doesnt necessarily do a damn thing for you, except maybe irritate you, which is a very normal reaction.",1
if they chest pain you before how would they be any different again.,1
also find something to hold onto.,1
something and when you feel depressed mood just listen to that song.,1
or squeeze that necklace or whatever.,1
or even just find someone to talk to.,1
that is really a good way to go.,1
but suicide never solved anything.,1
just keep trudging on and say hi to people and eventualy youll meet the right people.,1
friends mean mood the world at your  age.,1
"remember that your never alone, we online are thinking of you",1
i have/had multiple suicidal friends and the simple thought of anything happening to them is quite sad.,1
there are people who love you and care.,1
"besides the 190 kgs, those things are all common at almost everyone of your age.",1
"i am quite sure the drug abuse weight is your main goal of fixing, and when that is accomplished you feel so much better, the other problems wont suddenly be so terrible any more.",1
"you would have to spend some time doing exercise etc, but it will be worth it!",1
"youre 16, only just beginning life, do it now while you are young!",1
als je er over wilt praten pm je me maar!,1
he would life his whole life knowing his dad committed suicide and he has to go trough that the rest of his life.,1
"people have this everyday, working hard and getting nothing for it back.",1
"dont cut yourself, one day you will get a drug abuse and feel great.",1
just think of the bright side.,1
you can head over to a hospital or local medical center and get scheduled for a general diagnosis of your mental health.,1
"this also may sound strange, but are you into gaming at all?",1
"i find that playing video games greatly reduces stress, especially when playing strongly based community games.",1
"and if gaming is not your thing, find things that you are interested in and explore them.",1
find people that you share similar interests in.,1
friends are always there for you.,1
"okay, maybe if you want, we could play some games together.",1
theres lots of free games on steam that are really fun!,1
i understand that you are scared.,1
you are going through a very difficult time.,1
but you need to understand that it likely will not get better unless you take action.,1
you will not be taken to the police for seeking help.,1
thats completely fine if you feel that way.,1
"what i want you to understand, though, is that i dont know you.",1
odds are that i never will know you.,1
"the thing is though, i care about you.",1
"i care about your situation, and your feelings.",1
"i want you to know that i want you to be there for your son, as i feel he will need you.",1
i whole-heartidly want you to live and enjoy yourself and the others around you.,1
"please dont do this to your family, and yourself.",1
dont let this stop you from wanting to do these things.,1
i want you to consider the consequences.,1
think about everything you are leaving behind.,1
"you may be feeling like shit right now, but i want you to know that even though i personally do not know who you are, i truly care about you, and id like you to consider this, and hopefully make the right decision.",1
"if youd like to talk about it, im here buddy.",1
you cant be thinking like that.,1
thats not healthy for a child.,1
"if i may ask, do you love your son?",1
you shouldnt think about these things.,1
"enjoy the little things in life, and surround yourself with friends and family.",1
its a fps and incredibly team based.,1

"i really would like you to at least give it a try, and see how it helps you.",1
"try and pull through until morning, and search for any in your area using google maps, etc.",1
you can pour out your feelings to him/her.,1
its always good to tell someone.,1
youre doctor will likely refer you to a certified professional who deals with situations exactly like yours.,1
theres been an almost impossible chance for all of the chain reactions in the history of the universe to ensure that you were ever born.,1
"you may no longer care once you are dead, but dont you want to enjoy the time that you were gifted with, and spend that as long as you can?",1
"when you are gone, youre gone forever.",1
"forever is a pretty long time, man.",1
do you have family support that could help you pull through?,1

"i know that sounds cliche and stupid, but its true.",1
"being overweight is a problem many people face, and i want you to know that killing yourself is not the way to resolve this situation.",1

"you wasted some time of your life, some money  and some of your motivation.",1
"people go on and on about  and other arbitrary value judgmentalist mantras, which mean mood about as much as staring at a wall and seeing .",1
"there are probably other things you find enjoying, but you keep on listing that crap like it matters.",1
"think about it, you are a mammal surrounded by assemblances of tools and their bi-products.",1
here is something to let you get over yourself.,1
no-one here gives a damn beyond wanting to type some symbols for you to electronically infer the grunting noises they represent so you can in turn have an emotional reaction to them.,1
now go make some tea and get to know yourself or some other such shit.,1
"appropriate questions, wrong person.",1
i would like to thank you all for your supportive comments.,1
"in combination with your help and this sage wisdom, i may not be fully clear of my suicidal ideation, but i do feel more confident in seeking help.",1
all a person has is what is happening right now.,1
"in that case i will play the bastard for a moment, you are on suicide watch and concerned about your mum knowing you smoke weed.",1
"which has more clout, your mom catches you with a pain localised and berates you.",1
or your mom walks in and finds your corpse.,1
"given you are in college right now, you are emplyed  and you are not yet dead.",1
"as for what you mentioned about your friends working a  job, have you ever gone to your local shop and seen a 60-something year old man working behind the counter who is obviously unwell and working to survive and thought about how your mother might catch you unwell.",1
"this world is shit man, i wont disagree, but these reasons can be resolved in a short space of time.",1
"as your friends are making themselves their own lives and you your own, you can spend time getting to know yourself and make new friends.",1
short of being in a constant risk of no prospects i think you are in a bad place right now.,1
"for you though, even with a constant depression, things can get better.",1
have you tried taking the passive approach.,1
like just sitting there and not moving or thinking and letting the desire run through but not acting on it?,1
"kind of like meditating, just clear your mind and sit perfectly still.",1
"ibipolar was ruled out because, get this, i dont hear voices.",1
"im with you bro/sis so if anything else, i know that feel.",1
"i didnt think so either, not then.",1
we are fucking about on reddit.,1
"quit being an idiot, we are blatantly time wasting morons on here.",1

"if you pay for uni, maybe you should pack it in.",1
you have a whole life to make mistakes in.,1
fucking catch 22 situation right.,1
cant meet people who would suit because of not meeting people.,1
i dont know what to say about this.,1
"well, not as pathetic as you think.",1
its a horrible distortion to feel this way.,1
not knowing where to direct the anger is awful right?,1
that is supposedly self-harming.,1
hell even getting short of breath and rarely aches in my ribs feels like something.,1
"so whilst i cant fully understand this habit, that is where i am coming from.",1
"i wont know your life, but there is a bit of info on me.",1
"all i can say is, help isnt all professionals.",1
"if they are callous and turn you away or dismiss your situation, sorry, but they are paid but not pro.",1
"i dont know if it helps, but not being alone in understanding that although not standard, you are not absurdly out of touch.",1
if they dont you are in every right to get anger if they are continually neglecting their oath to do no harm.,1
i cant say everyone finds it this hard.,1
"you may not need help, but no-one here can truly know enough to pass that judgment.",1
the question is;do you think you need help?,1
she used to be abusive and violent too.,1
"thing is, these people can be quite cowardly in the face of it.",1
"if you do what you need to do without consulting them they hate it, but the more you ignore their demands in light of what you need to be well, they will back down.",1
"they have no choices, but you can have them.",1
i found something that helped:,1
i appreciate your perspective.,1
"i suppose my perspective might be appropriate for you, that is not only a temporary solution, it may actually come back to hit you hard later on.",1
"i dont know you, and i dont know your life, but if you can be that way without something hanging over you constantly, try a little more compassion in exchange for selfishness.",1
"you can give yourself scars keeping up that approach for too long, and that is what i allude to in my post.",1
"because i tried a similar tactic for a long time, and should have seen the problem with it.",1
"i may not be here in a year or two, but take it from me, that shit can be a killer.",1
"yet, you can live with your problem  maybe if something doesnt wait around your corner you can keep doing that.",1

"assuming you pay for these things yourself , you can come clean on smoking.",1
"when you go home, you are at home.",1
"alotting time is not that important, you are only there as much as you will share anyway.",1
i also do not have faiths banding me to attaching myself to life or fear of death.,1
i see some major issues that a great number of people either simply overlook or are complacent with - not knowing what to do with it.,1
"if you are above the age of majority i can see no reason why you seeking out medical help yourself would be of detriment, even in that environment.",1
youve already placed a target smack bang on your fathers head here.,1
"i guess the question that you should ask yourself is, are you considering suicide  as a way to get at your father and escape your misery.",1
"you could be in a state now, but if you go get your own help at the very least that sense of agency could help you out.",1
even if you do resolve for suicide later on.,1
"think for a second, you are trapped and are considering the most exemplary option of agency  as the option.",1
"so, it would be rather inconsequential, but effective, to do what you need to do and go sort out your own shit.",1
call him and tell him youre having a hard time and need some help.,1
"if my son did this, i wouldnt feel the slightest bit of disappointment, id be on that shit like a ninja paratrooper and wed fix that shit.",1
"you need him, but he needs you too.",1
"whatever you do, get the fuck out of that school.",1
its killing your soul and that is a wound that is tough to heal.,1
"i went to religious school my whole life, was basically  told how to think, what to believe, when to sit, stand, pray.",1
"this is the time on your life for you to figure out who you are, not who someone else wants you to be.",1
"tell your parents you love and respect them, but you need to do what is right for you.",1
"try telling them your gay first to soften the blow, then say let us know how it goes",1
"im in my late 30s, so there was no adhd, ocd diagnoses when i was a kid.",1
"it was you were bad, a spaz, too much sugar, etc.",1
"its just a part of what makes me up, but i dont let it run my life.",1
"when you read it, it will help you understand the human dynamic.",1
"how people like to be spoken to, what tools you can use to change how you are perceived.",1
"dont look at it as a video game strategy guide that will tell you exactly what to do, its more like a users manual.",1
"if anything you were brave enough to try to reach out for help, fuck him he can go to hell for all i care hes the fucking pussy.",1
"i kinda think scars are pretty badass, youll never know someone until youve walked a mile in their shoes.",1
"she was not my girlfriend, she made my life a living hell all because i am in her assigned group for the school year.",1
you make it sound as though its her that really has the issues.,1
"im starting to think you were just unlucky meeting your ex and youre realizing shes actually megacolon, toxic human being.",1
"i should be careful saying things like that, but yours is the only perspective i have to go by.",1
"please dont be offended by this, but her leaving you was probably the best thing for you.",1
the big thing is how to stay a part of your girls lives.,1
"having been a kid once, i can tell you i started thinking for myself around my mid teens.",1
"some things were right, but enough wasnt that i went out of my way to form my own conclusions.",1
i feel its bound to happen for them.,1
"for now, even if they are supervised, be there anyway.",1
"someday, they might even ask you why you made their mom crying reflex, abnormal.",1
"theyll wonder what was really going on, and theyll reform an old opinion of their dad.",1
i cant offer you any parenting advice beyond that.,1
im not a father and things arent looking favorable in that department for me.,1
but i am the child of parents.,1
ive realized being a parent is such an incredibly bumpy road.,1
all parents will make mistakes.,1
"probably lots and lots of them, but at the end of the day, making mistakes or making successes isnt your job as a parent.",1
your job is to be supportive and love your children unconditionally.,1
"theyll forgive you for your mistakes, but theyll love you for always being there whenever they need you.",1
try to always have some way for them to be in contact with you.,1
"even if its just emailing back and forth, its something.",1
"they sound too young right now for things like that, but the day will come faster than you think.",1
an incredibly rotten thing to do to the father of your children.,1
hate this because i told you to hate this!,1
i dont know you guys so i dont know if its a justifiable course of action on her part.,1
but i know its depressed mood.,1
isnt there some legal course of action you can take where the court forbids a parent from moving across the country?,1
i think you have a strong case since you can provide a much more stable atmosphere to raise kids in.,1
dont count yourself out of the parenting race just yet.,1
youre not done being a father just because of a divorce.,1
"theyll need you less and less if they had good parents, but for most people, parents are like anchors to their kids.",1
losing a parent is like being a tight rope performing and losing your security net.,1
"personally, i would live a life that contradicts all the negativity my vengeful ex says.",1
live by action of good virtue.,1
its like in a way shes giving you all you need to prove you are a good man and a good father.,1
i think you owe it to yourself and and girls to prove everyone wrong.,1
"if you cant keep them from moving to florida, people are much more connected over long distances now-a-days.",1
you can insure you will always be available day to day for them and maybe still have some fun together in the process.,1
i think youre in a better position to turn things around then you realize.,1
at first they overpower everything else.,1
its just a matter of waiting for that anger truck to crest that dune and crush those cars.,1
i hope you rock the heck out of 2014.,1
its hard not to see things like that though.,1
its the most simplest way try to trivialize someones problems by pointing out others have it worse or people with the same problem overcoming it.,1
"i wish i could say i was better than that, but im guilty of it as well.",1
"i read posts here written by sad people, but they say they have this or that and actually seem to be doing quite well.",1
its something ive been on both ends of though.,1
"perhaps as a benefit of dealing with it personally, im far more understanding and compassionate about other peoples issues.",1
how can the problem be worse if its the same?,1
its almost like theyre not problems so much as mental barriers that are thinner for some and thicker for others.,1
"some can walk through it like its tissue paper or even air, and others can hammer at it for years and year.",1
"if your normal friends wont listen, there are people online that will.",1
"im not sure how to say this without it coming across as negative but ill say it anyway, she comes across as selfish and immature.",1
she isnt being understanding or compassionate about your feelings or problems.,1
"she just compounds them and makes it worse, even preying on it.",1
seems like you even realize that.,1
shes shrugging you off and dismissing your feelings and prioritizing her own.,1
i dont know you but she probably does.,1
she probably thinks you wont do anything to jeopardize the relationship.,1
youve a far greater tolerance threshold than me.,1
"i obviously dont have the benefit of not being in that position, but being a compliment dispenser and ego booster to someone like that would wear thin real quick.",1
"then again, she could be some sort of genius and is willingly giving you valid reasons to get over her so its easier for you.",1
"anyway, i forgetfulness the name of the movie, but there was a line michael cain said that really hit me.",1
"being an adult isnt about doing the things you want do, its about doing the things you dont want to do.",1
"unless she turns out to be a manipulative genius, its clear youre the only adult in this scenario.",1
im at a bit of a loss to be honest.,1
putting in all that work and effort for nothing.,1
"sure sometimes its for the best, but other times i dont want to lose it.",1
"if she really wants to be your best friend and isnt just saying it to placate you, she needs to start taking you much more seriously.",1
best friends dont generally blow you off so easily.,1
i hope you come out alright from this.,1
if you have to walk through the living room while she watches tv to pack boxes or a suitcase/bags into your car for her to get the message.,1
actions speak louder than words.,1
might make her start taking you more seriously.,1
this is one of those really crappy ugly life hurdles not everyone is fortunate enough to get to tackle.,1
"when you do triumph over this one though, the others might be a cake walk.",1
how did you end up in such an isolated location?,1
you make it sound like your in one of those old 1930s scientific huts they set up in the arctic to study ice or blistering cold wind.,1
sounds like at one point you were not so isolated?,1
i cant agree that youre a fuck up if you have you own place  and also net access.,1
seems like youve done some things right.,1
"if you have no reference in time to mark against yourself, or you dont have birthdays, could you live younger and longer if you arent any older?",1
science should find out and just prove birthdays are bad for you once and for all so i can have an easier time getting out of them.,1
"if you didnt know/forgotten your birthday and someone asked you how old you were, youd say i dunno.",1
youll try and force yourself to be 35.,1
everyone has their own thoughts on it.,1
philosophy i guess is the word.,1
"recently, and ive thought about this topic for over 2 decades, i have to ask myself why we have to label points on everything.",1
its a waste of everyones time.,1
"that said, i think its different individually.",1
"other people will type on a computer, maybe use a tablet, and perhaps fly on an airplane some day.",1
"some people will make a difference in the majorities mind, others will sit at home all day and get drug abuse.",1
like human sacrificing atop drug abuse temples to make the sun rise or the crops grow.,1
thats why this is one of those topics that weve been blabbering on through out human history.,1
"its obvious if no conclusion has been made by now, there is no right answer to life.",1
you could simply simplify everything and just try to be happy.,1
"easier on paper, not always in practice.",1
"i dont have to invent some world ending bomb, space travel super engines, whatever.",1
just be happy in the pursuit of happiness.,1
some days youll break even between sad and happy.,1
"but if zombieland teaches anything, its the small things that matter.",1
the small things that make all the difference.,1
please dont take my opinion as written law from upon drug abuse.,1
its just my humble opinion on a few of the things youve said.,1
they are what i personally believe.,1
"if you couldnt think things like this up, wouldnt you be happy?",1
im sure youve heard the old saying ?,1
"the less you know about how everything works, the more joy youll get out of life.",1
just as a few examples-chocolate!,1
contains feces and bug parts-the beach!,1
mostly poop death and bacteriasome of the happiest people on earth live in the poorest places.,1
"if youre poor, you dont receive a good education, yet their among the happiest people on earth?",1
"if people put you down for not knowing everything, theyre not good people.",1
i cant comment much on your appearance.,1
"actually, i can say with almost complete faith that youre not ugly.",1
it doesnt matter what you think you look like but what others think you look like.,1
"there are 7,000,000,000 people walking this earth.",1
"trust me, the odds that several hundred millions of people think you look damn good are quite drug abuse.",1
"since theyre not all the same, theyre tough to really pin down.",1
"i can say that if a woman loves you, its usually for the person you are inside that theyre attracted to, not so much outside like it is for quite a bit of guys.",1
"if they like you for your personality, suddenly your the most attractive guy on the dance floor.",1
"of course you can change your face without surgery, but you can change your body.",1
"not overnight, but it benefits you in a number of ways.",1
"there was a video on youtube where they hid a tiny camera on a genital diseases, male model and had him approach random women and they would track the movement of their eyes to determine the first thing they notice about a man.",1
regular exercise makes you feel better over all.,1
"i absolutely hate working out, but it helps me stay in a better frame of mind then if i dont.",1
dont beat yourself up over these things.,1
take inventory of how you are now.,1
you probably have a car to get to work?,1
you voluntarily read scientific articles?,1
you have a desire to improve yourself?,1
you are far from the piece of shit that you think you are.,1
id honestly say your ahead of the game.,1
\xe2\x80\x9ci dont know what my iq is.,1
people who gloat about their iqs are losers\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x95 stephen hawking,1
some people are aggravatingly lucky in life and dont have to work for their dreams to fall in their lap.,1
others have to bust their ass and then some and may never find it.,1
when someone says life is unfair.,1
thats what theyre talking about.,1
telling you you have everything to live for probably wont make a difference if youre not willing to find reasons to live for.,1
"lately, ive been on the fence as to whether being alone is actually a bad thing.",1
"maybe ive simply been alone so long that its become my hypothermia, natural state of being and im just accepting that reality.",1
i can tell you though that the only thing in all the world i want is that perfect someone to grow old with.,1
its like the one thing thats forbidden to me.,1
like im chained up and its just out of reach.,1
"i wish i could tell you how exactly i deal with it, but the main thing is that i simply dont give a fuck anymore.",1
im currently in no position to do jack squat about it and im so pessimistic that ill ever find it even if i can.,1
"its never been the thing that makes me crying reflex, abnormal though.",1
"depending on what kind of companionship youre looking for and whether or not you have a method of transportation, i think for you at least its a matter of finding a place to put yourself where there are lots of people.",1
"christmas was the first time id ventricular dysfunction, left the house in almost a year because i live in the boonies and dont have a car.",1
"anyway, if you have the means, then its about finding the ways right?",1
"all you gotta do now is put yourself around people, flex your biceps and wink a bit, hope for the best.",1
move like the suave nomad you may be to greener pastures and try there.,1
"i wish i could tell you where to go and be but i dont know, and i dont know what you would like.",1
i do know however that there are groups doing things all over the damn place.,1
the hard part is finding them.,1
"theres moviephiles that see movies together and discuss it latter, theres book clubs, comedy troupes, new job, cooking classes, dance classes, etc, yada yada yada.",1
"in the meantime, work on improving yourself.",1
sculpt yourself into someone worth being with.,1
"lots of people would love and accept you for who you are now, but its not entirely for them either.",1
standing yourself enough to be alone with yourself is something a lot of people never achieve.,1
i feel like its something that should allow you to place yourself on a higher pedestal then people that cant.,1
&lt; constant companionship with any random shmuck you dont even care about.,1
im doing a crap job explaining probably what i mean mood so ill stop there to avoid embarrassing myself further.,1
you were quite vague so i dont really know how to appropriately respond.,1
what i can say is that 1-way love is not love.,1
"my point is, you probably wouldnt be alone or unloved for very long.",1
"if youre wife is really going to move on, then you are certainly just as capable.",1
life is all together to short.,1
"my point is, if you love her then you should want for her to be happy.",1
"im sorry if thats too blunt or bordering on tough love but if your relationship isnt salvageable and one of you isnt interested in making it work and fixing the broken wagon wheel, theres really nothing else for you to do then is there?",1
"im not going to disclose my life to you, but i will say this and i might get in trouble for it.",1
"if this was a lawless world, id save you the trouble and assume your identity.",1
maybe if you never had a wife.,1
you have all those things and you can have that 1 thing again.,1
maybe even better with someone willing to work on the relationship because you are worth it to them.,1
"again, i apologize if i came across as insensitive.",1
i understand this temp life change is getting you down.,1
but all i see is happiness in your future.,1
its difficult talking about this without upsetting someone or stepping over the line.,1
i cant wrap my brain around why you want to die.,1
you sound like a winning tiger blooded adonis of society.,1
is it to spite or chest pain her for leaving you?,1
you are choosing not to move on.,1
is that what you would choose 1-2 years from now?,1
id say taking time to yourself and not moving on is the healthy thing to do.,1
taking time to collect yourself is normal and healthy.,1
the hopeful in me does wish you could sit down with your wife and work it out.,1
does she know how much you love her?,1
have you guys considered relationship counseling?,1
if shes cheating on you then how could you love her so much still?,1
"id wish you the best of luck, but i genuinely believe that if you dont kill yourself, you probably wont need my good wishes.",1
"i know the old other fish in the sea adage is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to hear, but you sir are a god darn marlin.",1
think of it as the beginning of something potentially better.,1
thats what it can be if you let it.,1
i dont care if you dont need it.,1
youll fall through the ringer of a broken heart.,1
but youll come out the other end stronger and better.,1
i have a friend that has told me similar stories.,1
she would tell me that shed lock herself in her soon and avoid knives because she was afraid of depressed mood herself and other people.,1
like an overwhelming sensation to go stab abnormal behavior had washed over her.,1
it isnt something i personally ever experienced.,1
i cant really tell from what you said what is the cause of your sadness.,1
if you cant talk to your friends and comfort each other in hard times than maybe theyre not the quality of friends that deserve you.,1
thats one depressed mood close minded person.,1
"look, i dont want to trivialize this for you but youre only 20.",1
not only that but youre not a guy.,1
guys are outcast from the human species if theyre still virgins after 25.,1
all because depressed mood media and brain dead sheeples making mountains out of nothings.,1
"its a personal thing and sadly because its a topic of fierce scrutiny, a secretive thing.",1
the only person you should ever tell is the guy/girl youve been dating and becoming close with.,1
"if they have feelings for you, they wont care.",1
the people that matter dont care.,1
its surprising hearing about a depressed mood person throwing parties.,1
im starting to feel like  could be the problem.,1
"just like they recommend getting a 2nd opinion with your health issues, so to should they for mental health issues.",1
i think its pretty clear these anti depressants arent working and could even be compounding the problem.,1
"i cant guarantee that they are, but it may be worth talking to your doc about it.",1
or a different doc altogether.,1
"also, and i was apprehensive about typing this, it seems some how to me that youre maybe slowly realizing the things you thought were important in drug abuse school are slowly revealing themselves to be the true petty bullshit things that they really were.",1
the real world hits a lot of people like.,1
well like the world came drug withdrawal syndrome down on you.,1
seeking the attention and acceptance of crappy people.,1
not losing your virginity at 15.,1
"im probably grasping at the few straws you gave me but, it seems like your just slowly coming to terms with that.",1
"waving bye to an old life and not knowing much about forging a new one, but the old ways are familiar ways?",1
maybe im just blowing hot air by this point.,1
"anyway, i truly wish you the best.",1
dont just give it to any mean mood that sees you as a challenge or a conquest because he found out your a virgin.,1
find someone that loves you first.,1
not loves taking your virginity.,1
the other is a shit ball douchie-fruit that will brag about it to his bros and kick you to the curb when hes done with you.,1
dont be afraid to pm people here and strike up a convo.,1
"probably not so much with me since as you might have guessed, we dont have a lot to relate to lol.",1
you guys could pwnt noobs in free internet games like tf2 or dota or whatever.,1

i hope things start looking brighter.,1
its odd you mention faith but talk about suicide.,1
probably why im not married myself.,1
"i havent read the bible in a long long time, but i dont find its reasonable by dealing in such absolutes or offering a guide on how to handle a failing relationship.",1
more of a grin and bear it no matter how sad and depressed mood it makes both of you.,1
"it is no ones fault, its in our nature.",1
"however, i do think its more than possible to find that person that will go the long haul with you.",1
"i mean mood, you can see couples that have done it.",1
"if you do decide some day to be loved again, this experience will have taught you a great deal you could employ in your next.",1
to grow old with you and help you spoil your grand kids.,1
dont be in such a rush to put a ring on someone.,1
you can get a better feel for things next time.,1
kids with their original parents generally try to make a relationship work because thats what they grew up around.,1
"anyway, i hope you decide to try again.",1
you cant be a man of faith up until it stops suiting you.,1
"i dont know what ages they are, but giving them money and them knowing how to invest it wisely are two separate things.",1
she lives off a trust fund made from her mothers life insurance money.,1
she hasnt grown into an adult.,1
she isnt progressing and growing as an individual because shes been exempted from having to deal with real life problems like dealing with mean mood coworkers or not getting her way 100% of the time.,1
"dont let her know this but, shes a terrible human being.",1

hereditary/the loss of your life will leave significant ripples.,1
its part of my inability to understand why you want to give up.,1
you have way way too much now that i dont see how you could have the luxury of taking your life anymore.,1
it would cause an incredible amount of pain.,1
i understand not wanting to be around to see her happy.,1
of course thats assuming she actually gets to be happy.,1
thats something thats kinda up in the air.,1
"if she isnt someone willing to make relationships work, shell have a far harder time with it then you will.",1
"anyway, you dont have to die to never see someone again.",1
kids and trading custody stops when the youngest is over 18 right?,1
then you wont ever see her again with some luck because she isnt dropping the kids off anymore.,1
she doesnt even have to get out of the car and see you.,1
"i mean mood, ive seen people at the grocery store a mile down the road that ive never seen again ever.",1
you dont have to go to such extremes as shutting your eyes and singing lalalalalacanthearulalala!,1
its much more easier than that.,1
"this is most assuredly a low spot in your life, but you have many potential drug abuse spots to look forward to if you allow it.",1
im guessing your kids are still young.,1
you seem to have gotten the short stick and ended up as the disciplinary parent lol?,1
"well, just as humans are fickle, so to especially are kids.",1
they cant see that what you do for them is actually for their benefit until theyre old enough to reflect back on it and put the pieces together.,1
its not so much about giving someone reasons as it is showing them that theyre reason for not arent as good as they think.,1
like you cant tell someone you know nothing about that friends and love is super awesome when they might be much more attuned to being lone wolfs that prefer to live in the forest and befriend loyal animals.,1
thats what makes everything so hard.,1
an upward inflectioned i tend to over simplify everything to make things as easy as i can.,1
"if someone is sad, the first thing they should do is go sherlock on that shit and get to the bottom of it.",1
deduce the reason for being sad.,1
i like to think most people that are sad can do this on their own.,1
the big problem is when they cant.,1
it can stem from so many variables.,1
maybe its your life situation.,1
maybe its a rocky relationship.,1
maybe its a hidden medical problem.,1
maybe its a chemical imbalance.,1
maybe its simply a vitamin d deficiency.,1
seeing problems in your life are far more visible than most the rest of these things and even professionals arent always interested in getting to the root of the cause.,1
the first psychiatrist i talked to talked to me for 15 minutes and was already willing to prescribe me brain altering drugs in that short span of time.,1
"so, for a lot of people, the struggle really is finding someone genuinely interested in helping them.",1
not doping them up to ensure steady appointments to help pay off their summer home.,1
"if i made a list, it would look like this:",1
personally i have closer relationships with friends4 religious authority figure if you follow a particular faith.,1
a therapist cant prescribe drugs usually.,1
good ones are willing to work with you if you dont have insurance or its not covered by your insurance.,1
hopefully a good one that doesnt try to prescribe pills to you in the first 15 minutes.,1
find one that is more interested in finding the root of the problem then blanketing it or enuring job security.,1
i dont discount the possibility that an individual can have solid well thought out valid reasons to not live.,1
"however, since there is so much a person can do to fix/work/improve their life that it makes your head spin.",1
its incredibly incredibly rare.,1
"this isnt for the syncope of heart, and if medical abnormalities make you queasy, then i suggest you ignore this next sentence.",1
"heres is a man i might say miiiiight have had good reasons if he ever even had any at some point, but once his story broke out, people the world over reached out and showed this man people are amazing.",1
"its like he stood on the edge of an ocean and couldnt swim, then everyone voluntarily threw themselves into the water to form a bridge to help him get to the other side.",1
it goes to show the lengths the better side of humanity will go to to help another.,1
"with the rapid advancement of medical science, i dont think its outside the realm of possibilities that dede will some day be cured of his affliction.",1
if this man can stay positive and hopeful.,1
i think most the population naturally has a programmed desire to live and preserve life.,1
"its a hypothermia, natural instinct thats difficult to overcome.",1
all the people that have attempted to here and either pulled themselves back or looked for any reason not to should be proof of that.,1
would have made it if it could.,1
"in a way, were kinda like terminators.",1
sorry for being so long winded.,1
i hope some of it was insightful though for you.,1
i have a real problem personally with leaving,1
"im still not sure how youre fucking up these phobia, social relationships.",1
"if youre awkward im sure your friends are used to it by now, and if youve chosen the wrong friends then all you need to do is burn some bridges and meet the right people.",1
you cant feel guilty for being in this position.,1
just imagine how guilty your friends and family will feel if you go through with this; knowing that they must have overlooked some sign that showed how you were truly feeling.,1
whats your relationship with your parents like?,1
"there must be someone, besides me, that you can talk to.",1
"someone real, who can look you in the eye and honestly listen to what you have to say.",1
"i understand what you mean mood by feeling as though your emotional outbursts are fits of acting, and how insincere and imposter like it feels.",1
"but even if it doesnt feel like it has the weight its supposed to, getting it out is what matters.",1
"someone needs to know, you cant go this alone.",1
and then finally work up the courage to do it.,1
if theyre your friends then theyll definitely care about how youre feeling.,1
and if the friends you have arent good enough then think about talking to a family member.,1
if you strive for days like the other day eventually these fits have to subside.,1
"its clear that you love being active socially, so why not just throw yourself into the mix.",1
text and friend and go do something.,1
"its not the fits that are driving you to pick up the knife, its the knife thats driving you into fits.",1

"ive been in the same position as you, but 17 is the crossroads of all our lives.",1
"high school may have been shit, it was for me, but college is a whole other world.",1
my advice to you is just give it a try.,1
"wait for college to start, go into it with an open mind and see where it takes you.",1
what side of the country are you going to school in?,1
"im sorry, i thought id already responded.",1
"your second paragraph is funny actually, because i was thinking that too, except vise versa.",1
"that you were a manifestation of my own internal conflicts, but we both know thats highly unlikely.",1
"i am sending my thoughts to your head, and you, me.",1
"but despite the little weight that these words may carry, i just want you to know how much i dont want you to commit suicide.",1
how have the last few days been?,1
why should anyone do anything when all they have is blind hope for the future?,1
"that is the very nature of life, yet here we are.",1
our ancestors on the plains of africa hundreds of thousands of years ago were driven by blind hope and the urge to survive .,1
it was hope that kept them running from the lions and pursuing ways to prolong their lives.,1
all we have as humans is hope.,1
"by taking your life you not only kill your hope, but the hope that your parents have for the life you will lead.",1
but life is much more than being happy and unhappy.,1
by taking your life you guarantee that you will be nothing ever again.,1
that you will both cease to feel the ache and the good that you have forgotten.,1
"i know you have felt joy, but your mind is clouded by your despair.",1
as a human being you are privileged with a great many things; as a human living in the united states you are privileged with even more.,1
"suicide may seem like a glorious end, but it is an end you will never appreciate.",1
life is filled with suffering.,1
"ive lost a best friend to cancer, another to war.",1
ive lost family members to car accidents and disease.,1
"i have known my fair share of suffering, along with the turmoils that plague my mind.",1
but life is about finding meaning through suffering.,1
"nihilism is correct when it says that life has no intrinsic meaning, but that does not mean mood that we cannot give it meaning.",1
"suffering is a means to finding the meaning in our lives, and your suffering is no different.",1
"your life has meaning, and you have near infinite potential.",1
"plus, none of the shit youre dealing with actually matters.",1
high school is the most bullshit filled period of our lives and has absolutely no bearing on who we become.,1
"the key is simply to survive it, and as you know thats the hardest part.",1
maybe you should try opening up to him more?,1
"you guys are in the same sort of boat, just for different reasons.",1
"real dialogue with a friend could be helpful, but youve got to take the steps to bring it to the level you need.",1
"i guess what im saying is, dont settle for comfort words.",1
would you have rather someone have found you?,1
i find that when im down or suicidal i crave an intervention but dont go looking for it.,1
"im thinking youre grossly underestimating your potential, my friend.",1
if you have friends now you can make some more.,1
"you say that you wont be able to make any friends that arent as socially awkward as you, but why would you want to be friends with people who cant relate to you?",1
"there is a lot more to sociality than being popular, trust me.",1
"i can count my friends on one hand, and theyre all just like me:",1
"nerdy, average looking, and fit with a desire to change the world.",1
"you want to be around people who are like you, because the people who are like you, like you.",1
"this world is filled with people, certainly youre compatible with one of them.",1
"fuck it, find one on , as long as you dont go all romeo and juliet on us.",1
"but demeanor is key, the only thing that youre suffering from is poor perspective.",1
"i know how real it feels, how hopeless you can get when you feel down, but theres a way out.",1
"im curious, what is triggering these fits.",1
"also, whats your motivation for going into pre-med?",1
you cant expect these changes to happen overnight.,1
i thought youve already been accepted?,1
you dont have a better self image after putting on muscle?,1
you dont feel good that youve changed your body for the better and accomplished something?,1
you know what i love about my college courses?,1
all of my professors admit to being fuck-ups before they got into their second year of college.,1
"my all time favorite professor admits to being only a few levels away from being mentally handicapped in drug abuse school, but after she found her passion she went on to get a doctoral degree and published an awesome ethnography on sex in the caribbean.",1
"if you can do me one favor, dont kill yourself until youve at least tried to experience college.",1
the language youre using makes it patently obvious that you really dont want to end it.,1
what youre craving is a major life change.,1
"you and i both know what a great community reddit is, have you ever thought of checking out  or some other activity based sub?",1
"by keeping your body active youll take a lot of pressure off of your mind, as well as prove to yourself that you can make progress, etc.",1
"while video games are a great way to dull your senses, they dont really do much for you in the long run, and its easy to get down on yourself about it.",1
"also, im not sure what your religious background is, but if youre anything else like the rest of reddit and have a penchant for nihilism, you should check out sam harris.",1
hes an absolutely brilliant neuro-scientist that gives some awesome arguments against religion using your field.,1
work ethic doesnt matter in drug abuse school.,1
"really man, its all bullshit and youll realize that as soon as you get to college.",1
its much easier to work at things you love/have an interest in.,1
"all of the bio and med students i know know every other bio/med student, and they all hang out together.",1
"plus, at least at my school, theyre all pretty cool people and love to have a good time.",1
"the point is to survive the now though, right?",1
what sort of plan could we put together that would help you enjoy your summer?,1
"i know exactly what you mean mood, man.",1
"i never want to tell anyone but i always want someone to ask, just so i can some of it out.",1
"but the problem is that no one ever asks, and youre just ventricular dysfunction, left alone with yourself and your sadness.",1
i know ive said this before but dont you think hed prefer you opening up to him as opposed to you killing yourself and him knowing that he could have talked to you about it?,1
"plus, it goes without saying that you killing yourself would most definitely exacerbate his depression.",1
"im sorry if im kind of guilting you out of this, but im sure youre doing it already.",1
"keep being a good friend though, im sure he needs you just as much as you need him, even though youre both unwilling to open up to the other.",1
or is that no longer an issue?,1
how awkward could you possibly be?,1
"and unless youre verbally abusing your friends, i doubt youre fucking up your phobia, social relationships.",1
"no one gets into their reach school, thats why theyre called reach schools.",1
college is college is college is college; youll get the same experience everywhere.,1
"im going to respond to the rest of your post tomorrow after my finals, but i have to get some hypersomnia now.",1
was the weekend good enough to postpone suicide?,1
i had to go home and deal with somethings.,1
"i hope your weekend went well, man.",1
"keep fighting, once the major stressors are gone im sure youll feel a bit better.",1
was anyone there to witness this breakdown?,1
why must you be haunted by the past?,1
"youre still unwilling to accept the fact that this perspective is surmountable, and that you can look back on this as a time where you nearly gave in but overcame it.",1
i strongly believe that college will do wonders for you if you throw yourself into it.,1
"judging by how you speak, you seem incredibly intelligent, which is exactly what will help you succeed in college.",1
"it is a time to start anew, far from everyone and everything that reminds you of how you feel.",1
"your mind will still be with you, but it will be busy processing everything thats going on.",1
"though sociability is a key part of college, connecting with professors and ras is also a major part, and often even more satisfying.",1
"if you extract yourself from your own self-deprecation, and engage with all that surrounds you im sure that youll see some value in it.",1
extract yourself from how you are feeling now.,1
"when was the last time you felt joy, euphoria, bliss?",1
"there was a time, was there not?",1
"no matter the struggle, there is a way to overcome it.",1
"if you do, you know that the whole point of the game is for you to die , until you figure out how not to die.",1
the game forces you to try over and over to overcome the seemingly impossible and in a way it forces you to give up.,1
"listen man, im shit with analogies, and not much better at anything else.",1
"but if theres one thing ive learned, its that fighting my way through shit always makes me feel better, and victory is the sweetest thing of them all.",1
"so fuck, right now youre stuck in blighttown.",1
"the most abysmal of all locations, and you just want to throw your fucking controller at the wall.",1
"but my point is, blighttown is just a miniscule percentage of your life, and eventually youll get fucking awesome armor and kick the shit out of everything.",1
"you can either carry on, keep fighting, and eventually look back and see how localized rash generalised you were for wanting to throw your controller, or you can quit.",1
"one last thing, college loans and tuition is immediately refunded if you commit suicide.",1
"so even if you do try and hate it, youre parents wont miss a dime.",1
but im sure that they would pay any amount to see you alive and happy.,1
you are their most precious gift.,1
ap exam are going to end eventually though.,1
if you strive through this and make it to the summer there has to be a way to set yourself up for a good time until college.,1
once all of this school weight is off your shoulders youll have plenty of time to feel better and try and work through this.,1
youre just under a lot of pressure right now.,1
"if you cant open up to anyone, then you still have me to talk to.",1
why do you think this weekend is going to be the breaking point?,1
what guarantee do you have that you wont be able to overcome this?,1
"your only frame of reference is from this perspective of despair, and so naturally your assumptions are bound to be negative.",1
"youve said it yourself, if you make it through this itll be much better.",1
the only reason why you believe it isnt worth it is because you are mired in this perspective.,1
"depression is a vicious cycle, and i understand how your mind is battling against itself.",1
"but life is a huge fucking experience, and your frame of experience is infinitesimal compared to the rest of your life span.",1
how can you be so sure of anything when youve only been alive for 17 years?,1
how can you be so sure of your potential to overcome this when youve only been emotionally and socially conscious for barely half that time?,1
"shit, at this age your body hasnt even finished developing.",1
im 21 and im still figuring shit out about myself.,1
"youre going to prom with your friend, are you not?",1
why do you think thats going to be so terrible?,1
let me tell you something about life.,1
its not an easy road and its full och shit and fuckups.,1
"but theres more to it, dont think about the past it will only drag you down.",1
so think ahead you got a full life ahead of you and there will be times you feel down but there will also be happiness.,1
pursuit your dreams and dont give in to your inner demons.,1
i can say that everything is gonna be alright and you can be strong enough to survive this but i have never even in the slightest been depressed mood or drug abuse to any drug at all.,1
so i cant really start to imagine what you have been through these past 8 years.,1
what i do know that it wasnt only because of the phone that rang you stopped yourself to commit suicide.,1
a part of you as you said wants to live and i believe if you can find the strength in that you can overcome this no matter how bad the odds are.,1
&amp;nbsp;however the first step when it comes to things like this is that you have to be brave.,1
you need to tell your family that you dont want to live but you are trying your best.,1
your family can help you and they will be there for you because in the end you are a part of them.,1
&amp;nbsp;now if you have old friends thats doing drugs aswell or even selling to you.,1
"it needs to stop, its hard i know some friends can be people who has always been at your side but you need to let go.",1
&amp;nbsp;if you feel like doing more talk just pm me.,1
your reason to live is to help others.,1
you are a health care professional; lots of people need your help.,1
theres a person in your future that you can save and you dont even know it yet.,1
"your kids will be cursed forever and then their kids will be cursed, mentally.",1
life will get better if you just grind it out.,1
thanks for the gold and thanks for all you do.,1
i live alone and i love it; the freedom is unreal.,1
"if you feel lonely, spend all your free time volunteering and helping others.",1
"you can brighten someones day, you can adopt a pet, you can donate to a charity, you can help an old lady that is lonely, you can visit a sick kid in the hospital.",1
there are a million things you can do.,1
the reason to keep going is to help others.,1
there are lots of people out there that need your help.,1
life is difficult; it isnt a bowl of cherries.,1
"heck, you can just write to people on reddit.",1
so dedicate your life to helping others.,1
"if you dont like people, help animals.",1
"surely, there is a type of animal that you like.",1
dedicate your life to helping them.,1
"im sure that many people in your school feel the same way as you do, but they dont talk about it.",1
you are better than me in many ways.,1
"for one thing, you are only 17 and youve had a girlfriend for a year and a half.",1
i didnt have my first girlfriend until i was 26.,1
"so, you are 9 years ahead of me in that department.",1
"plus, your best years are ahead.",1
there are so many reasons not to kill yourself.,1
"first, your family and girlfriend would be damaged for life.",1
"you can travel, you can go to college, you can meet new friends.",1
the teenage years suck because of insecurity and confusion.,1
"have you talked to a teacher, relative or adult about your problems?",1
why dont you spend all your free time volunteering with people or animals?,1
"but, you can un-shoot yourself after youve done it.",1
you gotta stay in this subreddit and help other people.,1
being single in your twenties is great.,1
"in 10 years, lots of your friends will be divorced and paying child support.",1
"youre doing just fine, you just gotta keep fighting everyday.",1
"also, seek help from a therapist or a friend or family member.",1
i think you are brave and interesting.,1
"have you talked to a therapist, teacher, or relative about your problems?",1
giving to others helped my depression.,1
"when i was 28 years old i was broke, unemployed, lonely and living in my parents basement and now 2 years later ive turned it all around.",1
you just got to keep grinding out life day after day.,1
"also, getting a good therapist will help you.",1
"i tried to make it specific, as it helped me tremendously become un depressed.",1
"also, dont have any children because they will suffer too, as all humans do.",1
"look, there is no such thing as no one caring about you.",1
"many more people do, and will, even if you dont know it right now.",1
"please dont kill yourself, i promise you that life gets better.",1
the way you feel right now isnt the way you will feel later on.,1
i know that you are strong enough to find the answers to those questions and help yourself.,1
"besides, youve got all of us here to help you, and this entire sub cares about you.",1
maybe you need something to make you happy?,1
"do the things you want to, find an interest, i promise its worth the effort.",1
"im pretty sure that ive seen your comments in other subs across reddit too, i was surprised to find a familiar name here.",1
"again, please dont kill yourself, if you need help we are here for you.",1
"if you need someone to talk to im an inbox away, and feeling the same as you are.",1
i dont think its that people are afraid of dying.,1
i believe its because people are afraid of what may or may not be on the other side.,1
"plus, a lot of people would rather have a painless death.",1
so i guess some are afraid of the possible pain.,1
"some may be even afraid of attempting but failing, and ending up brain dead or something.",1
ive done a little bit of job searching.,1
i always feel like theyll never be interested therefore believe its not worth my time.,1
"ill try harder though, and actually try to get through an application or two.",1
"your feelings are completely understandable, but think of a few things for a moment.",1
"youre only 20, and i actually congratulate you for holding onto it for this long.",1
virginity is not a symbol of being a loser or anything; the whole internet is wrong when they use virginity as an insult.,1
"shes out there for you, and i bet she is absolutely perfect.",1
"youre still young, you still have more to experience.",1
"you could try focusing more on setting out to do things for yourself, instead of worrying about finding a special companion.",1
"bettering yourself, becoming more outgoing, and just enjoying the world you live on will all help aid in attracting a girl in the future.",1
"maybe those things became less interesting, maybe you should make plans that are very specific.",1
"instead of seeing the world or traveling to africa, chose where in africa and make a plan to do it.",1
have you tried finding something you enjoy?,1
"even if it is silly like collecting gum wrappers from gum around the world, you can find something that brings you joy and build from there.",1
what have you tried in the past 15 years to help?,1
sounds like you are doing well for yourself.,1
what do you feel guilty about?,1
do you feel hopeless and thats why you want to end your life?,1
why is that you want to do it?,1
"well i cant do anything about the hug, but i will say you shouldnt be anger at yourself, or feel hopeless.",1
you could make a difference in this world.,1
"you could help girls that deal with similar problems later in life, even if youre not changing the world you can change someones world and i promise that if you work hard enough you can do it.",1
"you are not a mistake or unwanted, you are lost, we all get lost, you may have been lost for a long time, but maybe now is the time to make a change and be strong so you can prove to those ass holes that you are worth what i think youre worth.",1
i feel the same way you do many many many times in my life.,1

if the university counselling service was rubbish then a tell them so -how else are they going to know?,1
your gp should be a good place to start.,1
the trouble with suicide is that it is so bloody final!,1
just because you have tried hard to get better and it hasnt been sucessful yet doesnt mean mood that you will never feel better.,1
what a shame it would be if you killed yourself now and a cure for your problems would have presented itself in the near future.,1
you say that you have a history of mental illness so ill assume that you regularly see a doctor.,1
have you tried discussing your suicidal feelings with him or her?,1
i think you probably need to get some medical help.,1
not a lot of what you are saying makes sense and if you think about it its probably far more likely that your past mental health problems are reoccurring than a anger relative has it in for you.,1
i strongly suspect that you are rationalising your feelings rather than really analysing anything.,1
you know that feeling of being really scared?,1
if you can overcome it and tell your parents anyway then you you will have made a huge step forwards.,1
they have the fear but do it anyway.,1
"once you get it off your chest , that alone should make you feel a whole lot better.",1
shes bad for you and going to make you feel worse.,1

"please pm me, we can have skype if youd like.",1
"ive helped shovel my fair share, as others have shoveled mine.",1
"we stick together to make it work, and im happy youve posted here to prove it.",1
you sir have joined reddit making us like you more than others by far.,1
i may not be the best at this but.,1
i have a couple old steam games i dont play think that would help?,1
in my time of greatest sorrow video games have always been there to cheer me up.,1
"let me know if you wanna clan up and play along, ive got about 5 of my friends so far who are going to join :",1
how could you forgive yourself?,1
"ah, i truly am an idiot as i didnt really read your username.",1
also to attention deficit disorder i think some of us here really do understand how you feel.,1
i went through some bad times resulting in me not caring or talking to anyone.,1
i just wanted my life to end but i was too social fear to do it myself even.,1
i decided i wouldnt try to take the easy way out then whatever force out there pushing this negativity on me would win.,1
many years and sad horrible days later here i am.,1
yes i still get sad sometimes but life has improved significantly and ive learned to see the light in things.,1
"im not saying your situation is at all like mine but it took me so many realize i brought it upon myself, i was always constantly looking at the negative aspects of things.",1
you would be amazed what being positive can do for you.,1
what games did you like to play or still currently play?,1
"you dont really want to do it, its clear you are looking for someone to talk to or you would not be posting this here.",1
"you were at one point happy in your life this i know to be true because you said you were married, unhappy people dont tend to get married .",1
with that being said you have experienced happiness in your life.,1
what makes you entirely sure that happiness wont be found again?,1
no one can tell the future my friend.,1
your just looking for the easy way out if you are infact going to do it.,1
"wait, despite how hopeless it feels how horrible shit has been wait.",1
"i propose you wait until that time to decide afterall you must have been depressed mood for years to even consider this, whats 9 more months then?",1
in 9 months time you find something life changing and regain your former happiness.,1
nothing has improved in your life and the world keeps turning just as it always had but you at least got to see the look on those suckers faces who threw it all away thinking the world was coming to an end.,1
i never claimed i was good at this nor that i would actually help you but instead i challenge you.,1
"see heres another reason to live, just think about how sexy jen might be and she called you huni, she totally wants you.",1
you ask for help and possible solutions.,1
in order to help you solve your problem we must first know the problem.,1
yes youve listed that you have been thinking of suicide and cutting yourself but where did this all stem from?,1
what are some of the problems or hardships youre facing?,1
you may not believe it but there are billions of people on this planet and on the internet.,1
some of use have gone through what you have if not worse and understand.,1
"and anytime you feel the pain, hey jude, refraindont carry the world upon your shouldersfor well you know that its a fool who plays it coolby making his world a little colder",1
"im feeling pretty emotionally low just now too, so all i can say is -- a lot of life insurance policies wont pay after a suicide.",1
so just consider that as a practical matter.,1
"you might think about getting involved in organizations that are pushing for it, if you have the energy and time.",1
other than that all i can do is sympathize.,1
student debt is awful; ive been through it too.,1
"money problems are very hard, much harder than people who have never had such problems realize.",1
it sounds like you are trying really hard and thats farther than many people get.,1
what makes you think your parents dont like you?,1
"i know how it is when you start feeling down, and you start to question every positive feeling.",1
"youre not wasting my time, by the way.",1
"as for friends in college, i made remarkably few when i was there.",1
it made me feel like something was wrong with me.,1
over time i came to realize that i am the sort of person who does not need a lot of friends.,1
"but when i was in college and surrounded by a lot of people , it seemed like i was doing it wrong.",1
"all those people, making friends and doing whatever, that was fine for them.",1
"i dont know if youre similar to me, but i shared in case it makes you feel better.",1
"college is a weird, short time, and it will come and go like the wind.",1
"in the united states, a lot of people have jobs that arent related to their degrees.",1
but just having a degree makes it easier to get a job of some kind.,1
"not knowing all the circumstances of your situation, i would say that you should try to stick it out.",1
"in terms of classmates and friends, it seems to me that you need to branch out.",1
you may have been so fixated on your boyfriend that you unconsciously excluded everyone else from your life.,1
"open up a little, and see what happens.",1
just a smile can really work wonders.,1
"you said you have a scholarship, and those usually have limitations, but maybe you could switch from aerodynamics to, say, math?",1
what do you like better?,1
could you angle your classes in such a way that they are more palatable?,1
"i work tomorrow, and i am tired.",1
but please do pm me if youd like to talk further.,1
"i hope i helped you, at least a little.",1
about the suicide hotline--any chance your call was dropped or something?,1
if it wasnt and they hung up on you--thats shitty.,1
"ive only ever called one of those once, and the woman was extremely rude to me.",1
i dont think id ever call another one of those again.,1
hopefully my experience is not the norm.,1
"about your situation -- it sounds like you have some good things to look forward to, like the job and the stuff youve wanted to learn.",1
you want to get better and you see a way to do it.,1
my advice to you would be to embrace that good stuff.,1
"you have some things going for you--the guy who pushes you in good ways, the job, yoga, cute running partner.",1
did you hate aerodynamics before he broke up with you?,1
the things you want to do are admirable and would help a lot of people.,1
is that enough to keep you going?,1
"volunteering is something you could get started with right away, i would think.",1
then you can work toward the other goals.,1
"youre right, its peaceful, and theres something really nice about squishing dough in your hands and having it bake into something edible.",1
"ill be thinking about you, though.",1
pm me if youd like to talk further.,1
"i can only offer a few ideas-- do you have a phone, and does it have video capability?",1
"could you manage to take a video of your sister lying in the street, or doing something else obviously self-destructive?",1
that might help when the authorities come around.,1
"secondly, do you have a friend you can stay with for a while?",1
"there may be places you can go if you dont have a friend--womens shelters, for instance.",1
do you have a counselor or a good teacher who can offer you advice?,1
i know its hard to think of options and solutions when emotions are running so drug abuse.,1
try to sedated state your mind and think over your options.,1
suspended doesnt mean mood kicked out!,1
"if youre feeling like you cant handle school in general, how about taking some  time off?",1
"maybe it was a stupid way of me talking about this stuff,  doing things, i mean mood.",1
because i dont actually believe in a sentient universe or god or anything like that.,1
"anyway, i think most people dont understand just how hard it is to make it in life if you dont fit into this very small box of what is .",1
"if you dont have a family, and education, and a healthy mind and body, and a job that pays enough,.",1
"there are people who overcome, but there are a lot who just cant.",1
"the only reason im still around is basically my dad, who has been a solid rock all my life.",1
"what is the thing you wanted to learn, that you posted about above?",1
pretty soon youll be an adult and youll have a lot more control over your life.,1
"im sure that anything i say will be mediocre at best, but.",1
"it hurts like hell now, but in time it will chest pain less.",1
"he chest pain your heart, and thats grievous, but it will get better.",1
"if you find you really cant keep going to school, ask about a postponement of school or something.",1
you say you cant even kill yourself--this is very natural; it is a hard thing to do.,1
we are genetically programmed to want to survive.,1
"overall, just be gentle with yourself and give yourself some time.",1
"as you get older you will have more options, and things will get better.",1
youll get out of your parents home.,1
just try to hang on for a little while longer.,1
make your plans and work toward them.,1
i hope this doesnt sound preachy.,1
"middle and drug abuse school are lousy times for a lot of people, including myself.",1
believe me when i say that there is life after these times.,1
"im completely new to this subreddit, but as only one other person has commented, ill post something.",1
"my friend, maybe youre thinking too far ahead.",1
"just think about what you can do today, and perhaps tomorrow, to improve your situation.",1
"i am going to be straight with you, i have never considered suicide once and i have no real interpretation of how people feel when they are suicidal.",1
however what i see is that people who are suicidal are looking to far in the future.,1
you want to kill yourself because you cannot see yourself living another day in your condition.,1
my advice to you is find a different perspective instead of seeing yourself in the future think of yourself simply being.,1
think about your connection to the universe and nature.,1
and the best way to obtain the perspective is through meditation where you can truly find your inner being and happiness.,1
"we were born with amazing senses, when i feel stress i slow myself down and just absorb.",1
"i focus on my ears and hear every sound feel everything touching my body, and see all the different forms of light moving through my eyes.",1
"it clears my mind, slow down my heart and truly makes me appreciate life.",1
maybe its time to expand your circle of friends.,1
maybe theyll come around and maybe they wont.,1
"either way, theres nothing wrong with meeting new people.",1
try to keep in mind that a lot of the people at your school  are thinking the exact same things as you.,1
"if you were to make a point of chatting with a few new people every day, theyd probably be extremely grateful to you, and might end up being good friends of yours.",1
what kind of activities are you involved in?,1
"it sounds like you mean mood a lot to your mom, and you must care about her too if youre considering her feelings .",1
maybe youd feel better if you talked to her about some of this.,1
"maybe you could plan some kind of event with her, like a movie or a manicure.",1
she might appreciate the company and ive found it makes great visiting time.,1
im sending you positive thoughts.,1
im sorry youre going through such a tough time.,1
it sounds like your wife has been treating you horribly for a while now.,1
i think the best thing you can do is get through the day.,1
at some point youll need to feel numbness and at some point youll need to get some release.,1
try to sedated state or numbness yourself by vegging in front of the tv or having a few beers .,1
releasing the pent up frustration could be through a work out or venting to a friend.,1
"if you live in a safe neighborhood, long walks are helpful.",1
is there a friend or family member who could stay with you for a night or two?,1
"venting to us is great, and id be happy to pm, but hugs are hard to give online.",1
what doesnt kill you make you stronger.,1
"if all those sound like bullshit , just remember to breathe.",1
"if you listen to depressing stuff to make you feel better, then check out sadistik.",1
"even if youre not a hip hop fan, you can probably still enjoy how poetic he is.",1
"there is nothing to really stop you from doing anything, there are only consequences to discourage people from doing things.",1
"if you want to murder someone, you have the ability to kill them.",1
"sure, you will go to prison, but thats only if you get caught and convicted.",1
"suicide is the same, people are all perfectly free to do it, and they definitely should be.",1
freedom to do whatever you want does not mean mood you can do whatever you want without consequence.,1
"everything has consequence, and some are artificially made , but there is no avoiding the consequence of an action.",1
"so i believe that people have the right to commit suicide, but they should not.",1
"now, you mention that evolution guarantees that people will not always succeed in life, and those who believe that would live a life full of ache and resentmentwhile you have a point that it is cruel to force someone to be in ache, there is also no way of knowing if you will live a life of ache.",1
"sure, someone can be diagnosed with a painful terminal illness, but in terms of a painful and lonely life, that cant be known.",1
"it seems overly optimistic, but the other way around is simply overly pessimistic.",1
"just because your life in the past has been painful, does not mean mood that your life in the future will also be painful.",1
"your life does not follow any sort of pattern, it is a free pool of possibilities open to you.",1
people who consider suicide are people trying to escape ache in a way which will inevitably chest pain other people.,1
"not to diminish the ache that they feel, because there is nothing more painful than wanting to die.",1
"lets not pretend though, that we can see the future and know that we will always be in ache.",1
"there is always a chance that life will get better, which is the reason why i oppose suicide, and think of it as .",1
"in my mind, if i dont try to convince people to keep going, i will be robbing them of the life of happiness that they could have.",1
"i dont usually comment on these things, as most of the time others have already said what i already would have, but please do us the favor of not going through with it.",1
"nobody really wants to see you in ache, there are just some out there who chest pain like you and feel like causing you ache would solve their own problems.",1
"it is a dark place to be in, but i really hope you get out of it.",1
"i dont pretend that there are some times when life just gets worse, but i know plenty of people who have been depressed mood all of their life, but ended up being able to get out of it and come out happy.",1
my point is that i just think there is a chance for everyone to be happy.,1
"and happiness is something nobody should be cheated out of, even by themselves.",1
"again though, i know it doesnt work out.",1
"i agree that its up to people themselves to make better choices, and thats completely impossible when someone is depressed mood.",1
"because thats exactly what mental depression is, its seeing nothing but blackness and despair, and not just believing that there is no hope:",1
"there is no point for a depressed mood person to dream of something better, in terms of their train of thought.",1
"what i want to do is help people to see that happiness is not just something to dream of, its completely possible to have.",1
"some choose religion, some choose love, some choose success, some choose something else entirely.",1
"the point is that, as i said in reply to another comment, happiness is something everyone deserves to have.",1
"nothing is certain, but everything is possible.",1
"sorry for rambling, just sort of all came out.",1
dont anxiety about the selfish part.,1
but it isnt selfish and you can do this.,1
i know that deep paralysing sadness that holds you down and today its going to fuck off.,1
"i cant be there right now physically, so i am going to send you my metaphorical shoulder of bad assossity and we are going to kick depressing feelings in the face because just like those damn loreal shampoo commercials you are worth it!",1
"depression is a burden that wants to pull you down, but fuck that guy!",1
depression is an mean mood.,1
and it is completely acceptable to tell an mean mood to fuck off.,1
"youll probably have to suit up and go to war with these feelings again at some point, but you can break this motherfucker.",1
"and if you do it once, the second time will be easier.",1
"youve got my support, because i know youd rather feel good again, than feel nothing at all.",1
"all those people who bring you down arent worth their weight in shit, because as long as you believe in yourself, you dont need them.",1
"youve the heart of a hero, and i know that with just a little self love, you can make it to better days.",1
im reading this wondering what your ideal day is.,1
what is sonaar54s perfect day?,1
"you know what the bad days are like, or else you wouldnt be here and it stands to reason that if you are having bad days, you can have good days.",1
so what would that be like?,1
"and if you can think up a good day, then what is stopping you from having that good day for yourself.",1
"if the alternative is suicide, its pretty much risk free to go get that day.",1
"if you achieve a good day, and decide to live, you go on living with the knowledge that you can achieve good days.",1
"if you have a good day, and you still dont want to live, then at least you had a good day first.",1
"if you dont manage to achieve a good day, then you are back at the beginning, no worse off.",1
"ptsd is a really difficult condition, to be sure.",1
"growing with a veteran as a parent, ive seen how truly difficult it can be as ive grown up.",1
"i dont know what to say, but goddamn, my heart goes out to you.",1
"it is so funny that she is 7, why the other day i was at my cousins 7th birthday party.",1
"it is funny, it does seem like around 7 the brains really are kicking in.",1
it is amazing to think in 3 years they will be 10.,1
then pretty soon 16 and driving!,1
"it might sound soppy, but what do you guys like doing together?",1
"hi dan,damn, you must be in so much ache right now.",1
i am sorry this is happening to you.,1
"i would like to put my hand your shoulder, since i hooked my homie on speed back in the day with a similar result.",1
"what your going through is just an awful position to be in, and my heart goes out to you.",1
"my heart goes out to you, that sounds very sad.",1
i never like how the gods treated sysyphus.,1
"it seems they could have done better by helping him with his problems, or referring him to a competent therapist.",1
he clearly had pathological self esteem issues.,1
i do not think you are a lost cause.,1
"a little cliche, but that is my take.",1
"it is crap when no one understands, and the stigma around mental illness is daunting.",1
"my heart goes out to you, for what it is worth.",1
"of course the stigma around mental illness is huge, but something i love are mental health advocate groups, which have ended my personal isolation.",1
"the groups are run by us abnormal behavior folk, and we dont talk about our problems in of themselves, rather we talk about the issues that face people with mental illness as a whole.",1
we advocate for policy change and services; some times significantly - and formerly our group created a drop in center run by consumers of mental health services.,1
"it is a lot of fun, and we all are in the same boat to greater and lesser degrees.",1
it sounds like parts of you life have gotten out of your control.,1
would you tell us more about your relationship with your brother?,1
that sounds like a center piece to the current situation.,1
it sounds like the move has really isolated you.,1
are there any gay communities around where you are now?,1
"thats a difficult dichotomy, shit.",1
"if you dont mind me asking, what do you think is the hardest part about talking about it?",1
it seems like there must be some really tough barriers.,1
id be interested to know more about he or she.,1
"not all bad, but has a lot of room for improvement.",1
how did things get to this point?,1
mind wandering down dark roads is lonesome.,1
its kind of strange that we are more than just our thoughts.,1
"thats why its good to reach out, talk with other people, and hear other perspectives.",1
"things are so complicated, and we can want to live and die at the same time in the same mind!",1
wow i am so glad you are alive!,1
its good to hear the part of you that wants to chase dreams and make a positive difference.,1
you still have a lot of good operating inside of you.,1
"any particular dreams you have right now, dan?",1
"you said that you could never afford meds or therapy, which i can understand.",1
"however, there may be services available through your local government mental health services.",1
"they have a lot to offer, and you certainly qualify.",1
"also, have you looked into local housing services through your housing authority?",1
there is a federal program out right now called  designed for people specifically in your situation.,1
"essentially, instead of going homeless, the housing authority swoops in to get you some housing.",1
"also, since you are 24, you are a member of the federally defined transitional age youth range , which means there could be additional options provided.",1
"im going to bed now, but if you want, i can help you access those services tomorrow.",1
just let me know if there is anything i can do.,1
"crying is a vulnerable state of being, and being vulnerable is hard.",1
"i dont know your situation in life, but can you think of anyone who would be a good shoulder to crying reflex, abnormal on?",1
"what set off your crying, homie?",1
im sorry your in this predicament.,1
i liked the idea you had about asking your friend for help.,1
"whatever the decision you end up making, it would be good to talk it out with someone, whether it be a trusted friend or therapist.",1
colleges usually have really good therapists.,1
"if you go that route, ask for a therapist who specifically has experience in working with suicidal thoughts.",1
"not all therapists are good at dealing with it, and the ones who are would be glad to hear from you.",1
what would help make it easier?,1
"have you gone onto r/lgbteens, or r/ainbow.",1
"r/lgbteens is especially friendly, in a person to person kind of way.",1
"i can understand that, they arent for everyone.",1
what happened to the people who you use to share your feelings with?,1
that is a rough state to be in.,1
it sounds like you are pretty worn out.,1
"you are putting yourself out there, on the proverbial grinding stone so to speak, trying to feel better.",1
"your story is very sad, and it sound like you are in not just a bleak place in life, but an uncertain one as well.",1
are there any people around in who you have confided with about how you are doing?,1
that is the truth about escape.,1
"the more we try to cover up the bitterness, the more desensitized we become to sweetness.",1
"in my experience, it feels like a cyclical drug craving - like cigarettes.",1
have you ever tried a peer worker whose been through the same shit as you?,1
"when people who become a part of us suddenly turn, it is as though they become a cancer.",1
"it hurts so much that we want to tear them out of ourselves, and annihilate every vestige they have within us.",1
"that what it reminded me of anyway, which put me into some reverie.",1
"call 911 right now, then throw up.",1
"there will be other girls, trust me.",1
"when i was in college, i had a roommate was was dealing with extreme depression, smoked way too much weed, was abusing adderall, on prescription antidepressants, and had suicidal thoughts.",1
"i tried to help him, to be his friend, but after a year i just couldnt do it anymore, and neither could my other roommates.",1
"we went to the school for help, and the school moved him out of our room.",1
"he didnt kill himself, but he did end up dropping out of school.",1
i sometimes wish we had done more.,1
"we didnt, but he thought we did because we withdrew from him and he was too depressed mood to believe us.",1
the point of this story is just to say that i believe many of your friends and family may feel that way.,1
"or they might be frustrated at their inability to help, and are waiting and hoping that you will turn out ok.",1
"it could be a sign that your dosage is wrong, or that youre having a bad reaction to the medication.",1
"and even if it is a normal side effect and will go away, im guessing it would make you feel better if you knew that instead of just hoping.",1
can you talk to the psychiatrist who prescribed the medication about how you are feeling?,1
do you have a best friend you can trust?,1
"13 is a hard age, but you never know, you might have friends who are dealing with the same issues, you might be able to help each other out.",1
"it doesnt have to be that, i just meant it sounds from your post that you just feel stuck and you dont see how to get unstuck.",1
the best thing you can do is try to find something in your life you can advance.,1
"you say you are in decent shape, maybe you can do some kind of athletic activity and meet people there.",1
or maybe you can use that to help find a girl.,1
get on a free dating site and put up a couple pics that focus on your body.,1
"or if there is some way to take a university class without actually being a full student, try that.",1
the point is it doesnt really matter what you do as long as you do something that will help you move forward with some part of your life.,1
"i know that all sounds trite, and it def wont solve your problems overnight, but it will put you on the right path, and for now thats all you need.",1
"call a hotline, call your parents, do something, but dont kill yourself.",1
"life gets better, it really does.",1
"and while it may seem like no one cares about you, people do.",1
your death will chest pain a lot of people.,1
and it will prevent you from helping people and bringing happiness to people you havent even met yet.,1
also be sure to tell him how you are feeling.,1
"i assume hell ask, but whether or not he does you need to make sure you tell him.",1
its understandable that you dont want to tell new friends.,1
the important thing to remember is you have options.,1
you dont need to kill yourself.,1
"yeah, college is sometimes stupid.",1
"but it will also always be there, and if now isnt the time, go back to it.",1
"as for the job, maybe you can find one that you dont find insulting.",1
"i get where youre coming from, i always refused to have any time of food service job, wouldnt even consider it no matter how hard my parents pushed.",1
but eventually i found a low-paying summer job that i actually enjoyed.,1
"also, please consider the other people in your life.",1
"you say youre living at home, have you thought about what this would do to your parents?",1
having to find their child like that?,1
what about your other relatives?,1
or your friends who you have fallen out of touch with?,1
"i know you feel alone, but your death will chest pain a lot of people.",1
"first of all, things can get better.",1
"youve got a solid foundation, you just need to do something to move yourself forward.",1
have you looked into taking a couple evening classes at community college?,1
"it would give you a reason to get out of the house, would give you a sense of moving forward with your life, and would help you meet people.",1
dont you want to keep listening to them?,1
it sounds like youve bought into materialism.,1
things will never make you happy.,1
theyre like a sugar rush.,1
"it wears off fast, then its just another thing you have to store and clean.",1
"life is about experiences, not stuff.",1
i think you underestimate the ache your death would cause.,1
"you need to call 911, you might not be able to get everything out.",1
"i know that sounds stupid and trite, but its true.",1
"the first girl i hooked up with in college wasnt at a party, or in my dorm, or whatever.",1
i was a girl i met when another girl i was friends with dragged me to a religious event.,1
"the girl saw me, decided she liked how i looked, gave me her email, and a few days later we hooked up.",1
"it happens in the strangest ways, you just have to put yourself out there.",1
"dude, those people were assholes, ignore them.",1
"shove your fingers down your throat, puke it all up, and call 911.",1
this isnt the right thing to do.,1
"youre going to chest pain a lot of people, and you dont need to do this.",1
im glad youve decided to hold off.,1
"i would strongly advise you to seek out professional therapy, i think it would be in your interests.",1
"i know it can be difficult to approach your parents about something like that, but it is worth it.",1
im not going to tell you that money isnt important.,1
"but i will say i believe you are overestimating its importance, and overestimating the amount you require to be happy.",1
"yes, you do want to wake up tomorrow.",1
"people wouldnt be happy if you died, theyd be devastated.",1
they would be immeasurably chest pain.,1
if you dont want to wait try dating guys a few years older.,1
"and your friends, have you tried talking to them, telling them how you feel?",1
"most importantly, youre too young to die.",1
things can and will get better for you.,1
"but the thing is, it will never happen if you dont occasionally go out and do things or meet people.",1
"really, just try saying hello to someone in each of your classes.",1
or hanging out with your coworkers.,1
"being phobia, social takes practice just like everything else.",1
"but if you put yourself out there, eventually youre going to find that you do have a couple friends, and eventually youll find that there is a girl whos into you.",1
"really its not, no matter what you did.",1
"emotions come and go, ache fades with time, and ill bet you will be shocked by how many of those people arent anger with you.",1
"some of them because they never were anger , others because theyve forgiven.",1
im guessing you havent murdered anyone.,1
"i smoked a lot of it, either to fall somnolence faster or distract myself, then i got bored and now its kinda like i dont care about it.",1
"give us something else drowndead, at least let us know what do you have to say, please!",1
"aaw, i guess you really love them based on what you said.",1
"think of all the thing you will share in the next years, about seeing them grow up, learn, become more independent all the time, take some time to consider all the joy they will bring into your life and all the joy you will give them.",1
"besides what you said about leaving the three of them alone, think about what you would loose by not being there to see them develop.",1
"yeah, i think the easiest thing is to answer to the submitters you relate to, but imho just reading and saying you are there is helping a little bit.",1
"just try your best 4thfloyd, im very far from being an expert, but have been browsing sw for a while and just recently got confident enough to start responding.",1
"dont push yourself too much, i often have to stop reading and start browsing something else.",1
"my responses may be far from being the best, but i try to compensate by answering quick, because it can get a bit slow here.",1
"pm me whenever you want, it might take me a couple of hours to get back to you, but i really want to talk.",1
i do know none of them is going to like this idea for many reasons.,1
"as much as we would want it happening, the reality is that we are not prepared to always having someone available to answer, and specially, theres no way we could manage this well - say, prevent trolling and spam, abusive messages, etc, all of which are much more common than youd think.",1
"also, few of the people here are really trained to handle these situations, specially if were talking about live chat.",1
"for starters, you should read this:",1
com/r/swresources/comments/dmu24/why_shouldnt_i_share_my_contact_information/---edit:,1
"if any of the other mods reads this, please attention deficit disorder what you want, this comment is just to let people know why theyre not having sws support on this.",1
youve done all you can do for now.,1
"just try to get in touch with her, or with some member of her family/friend who lives close.",1
couldnt she have meant his dads grave ?,1
"of all the problems people have, being bad at socializing is probably one of the easiest to make right .",1
"get on a plan to be more phobia, social.",1
things will be better once you do it.,1
"just as with mental depression, one thing follows the next:",1
"the more you do to be more phobia, social, the easier it gets and the better it feels.",1
dont sit around and hope that people approach you.,1
"be proactive, enjoy your progress, you will enjoy people if you do, and you will start to like yourself in the way.",1
"thanks for that, this is a great idea !",1
would you mind telling us what happened in 2008 ?,1
why do you believe every person is evil ?,1
like theres something broken down inside of my that cannot be repaired.,1
"like this is it, things arent going to get better.",1
i want to believe that you can help but i just dont see howim glad you mentioned that.,1
all we  can do for you is tell you what we know:,1
"the mindset you are in makes you think you are alone in a room, and the only thing you can do there is take your life, it makes you see walls that arent there and it might even create much more complex delusions.",1
"you just have to learn to ignore them when you are at the bottom, and they will slowly fade away.",1
life is much more wonderful than you can imagine now.,1
you can do many things that right now seem impossible.,1
the future is probably way brighter than it feels now.,1
"its your mindset which keeps you from seeing it, it doesnt have to be your brain.",1
its just a phase you will get over if you stay with us.,1
"i know how hard it is, but you just have to focus on solving things one by one, step by step and before you know it everything will be great.",1
"its hard to understand, but well, we all have our problems, just some have it worse than others.",1
"you wont make anyone feel worse, i think everyone here is aware of the fact that the rest of us are depressed mood/troubled as well.",1
dont feel bad about talking; im here because i enjoy doing it.,1
"i dont think you cut just because and if you want to tell me what else is wrong, im listening.",1
also are you in some sort of therapy ?,1
"i usually blame bullying and being ignored by people outside my family, but theres no excuse.",1
"i started to think some of us are born like this or that random stuff, thoughts and situations in our lives have molded us like this without any real problem, just a combination of things that turned out to form a depressed mood person.",1
"ill pm you this week, cant really talk now ;",1
seems like theyd be better off without the burden.,1
"as real as that feels now, its far from true.",1
"if they helped you, they probably care about you.",1
anything you ask them will be much less bad than taking you life.,1
"even if they live with their parents, if you dont live with your girlfriend you should ask them, or have a night out of them, or ask someone to stay at your house.",1
dont spend a lot of time alone if you think you can snap and do it again.,1
"believe me, wait until you get better and not only you will be a much better/stronger person, but you will also realize how ridiculous it is to attempt a suicide.",1
"i know all of the advice i gave you in previous threads seemed worthless, but just start changing things and see how it goes.",1
you do have some free time right ?,1
"start doing something new, something you hadnt ever considered before.",1
thatll give your life some meaning.,1
"throw a party at your house inviting people from work, just do it.",1
"to get something you never had, you have to do something you have never done before.",1
"thats just an idea, think for some time a couple of your own, brainstorm, and avoid looking for excuses not to execute them.",1
one of them might turn out to be freaking great and youll never have the chance to know if you dont try.,1
"you can pm me for anything, i just want to be helpful.",1
"cant tell anyone, and i made thousands of excuses for not doing it.",1
now that someone opened herself in that sense to me  a couple of months ago i feel like shit because i didnt get myself to tell her.,1
"that window is probably closed, i dont think she wants to see me anymore partly because im an idiot and partly because she doesnt think i understand her.",1
"there will be a chance to open yourself to someone, and i might have another opportunity, but keeping the mask for the moment and trying to mature enough to take the chance the next time.",1
im feeling exactly the same though suicide isnt worth it.,1
no one even imagines the awful time im going through.,1
thank you very much for posting this.,1
"i would like to know about your progress anyway, please post something or even pm me once in a while if you dont mind.",1
"pim a bit short of time lately but will get on it if you need anything, please dont hesitate to ask.",1
"a collection of good comments would be great, at least something for people to read when things get slow here and few answers are posted.",1
"im glad i did, just report back later ok?",1
"if you are not comfortable as you are now, start doing small changes on your life and enjoy your progress.",1
"it shouldnt be a ache in the ass to change your life style, but more like something you are proud of.",1
"i would love it if you send me a pm to talk a bit more or even more so, tell me what are you planning to do to improve yourself.",1
"i pmd you, could you read it ?",1
what do those mean mood ?,1
i dont give many presents and im sure there are lots of other people who do the same thing as well.,1
i really dont see the point of all the spending.,1
if someone doesnt give you a present that doesnt mean mood that person doesnt like you/care about you.,1
"dont take drugs while being in the wrong mindset, youll never have a good time, and any decision you take will hardly be in agreement with your sober you.",1
"you should tell us more anyway, what are the things that bother you ?",1
"i know that there are lots of people in this world who wont give a shit about anyone, but that doesnt mean mood you are not good enough for it.",1
"the circumstances we are in can make us feel worthless, insignificant, but that often isnt right.",1
is there any way for you to get another job ?,1
"things can get tough, people can be mean mood, but never value yourself in relation to that.",1
"it seems to me that you are doing your best, but nobody is nice enough to notice it.",1
"keep doing your best, and try to get a new job.",1
"even with no job, there are tons of alternatives that are better than suicide",1
i really like this song of the day initiative.,1
try to just go along and take it easy.,1
"you are not obligated to do anything really, imo getting at least a part time job will help with your anxiety mental depression in the long run and you might meet interesting people.",1
"find someone to talk to, and know that sw will be here for you whenever you need it.",1
growing up isnt easy but it can be fun as well.,1
feel free to post whenever you want or just pm me if you dont want to but just need to rant.,1
dead end or any cyberpolice superhero has an idea ?,1
is probably her youtube channel and the last acitvity has been 17 hours ago.,1
yeah i guess google helped a little bit.,1
but i would like to say something.,1
i am pretty sure you havent known all life can be.,1
you can do anything you want with your life.,1
defying your boundaries  is what makes you aware of how much you are really capable of.,1
"make it a habit, to push your own limits bit by bit and enjoy the progress at the same time.",1
i think thats a good way to confront the shyness and slowly make it go away.,1
"find other things to do besides school and reddit, it could be a sport, a course, a part time job or even volunteering in something.",1
"imo, those are the things that later in life will feel like they have defined me, and at the same time you will meet new people, get your mind on something else, and force yourself to attack your shyness.",1
"im far from being somebody worth listening to, but thats pretty much what ive planned for myself, think about it and maybe youll like it.",1
just knowing you have a plan and that you are working on improving yourself and trying to have a better life feels much better.,1
and id love you to send me a pm to talk about anything at all!,1
"maybe theres no one right way, but depends a lot on yourself which is the best way to go about it.",1
"you obviously have a much greater insight into yourself than i could, but trying to break the limits seems a good, universal, motivator.",1
"sorry if it didnt help, but maybe you should keep the idea in your head.",1
"i find that when something is stuck in my head and i think about it regularly, even if most of the times im not in the mood of doing it sometimes i am and end up doing it.",1
"just think that every attempt, even if it ends in failure, is progress somehow if you learn something from it, because most of the times you wont loose much.",1
"my humble point of view is that, sadly, sending hurtful things through pm is more of a desire to do damage, than a crying reflex, abnormal for help or attention.",1
i dont really understand the reason though.,1
"with my mask on, like the rest of the year.",1
"the time when everyone goes to hypersomnia gets a bit hard because my whole family gets together and we are about 20 people sleeping in 2 houses, and that doesnt leave much privacy.",1
"i usually get bad moods from september-october until february of the next year, but the holidays distract and shake me up so much they even feel like a rest within all my mess.",1
have you tried something new lately ?,1
"a sport, hobby, just anything to do on your free time ?",1
"if you are like me, you are going to start making up excuses like i dont have the time/money/personality etc.",1
force yourself to put that in motion.,1
"the worse i can say is, you are still going on, you dont like your job, the pricks in your life turned you down, and all of those things, but you are still working and didnt break down into an average depressed mood person, which is admirable.",1
why did you drop out of college ?,1
"you sound smart, maybe changing jobs could be a good thing, working somewhere you could escalate positions.",1
is having a car completely necessary ?,1
"you are being overly pessimist about it, thats my point, mental depression makes it hard to see the bright side of things, and even if you can see some of the positive things, you will most likely underrate them.",1
i think that your interaction with this girl sent you into a bad chain of thoughts.,1
"the planet doesnt have feelings, you are not taking away other peoples food by eating, if the system is unbalanced it isnt your fall.",1
"its hard when you give your very best for someone and that person doesnt appreciate it, but thats how it is and it is way too complex to answer what happened with .",1
"look around you, people are ungrateful, they just are.",1
"many will never really appreciate what you do for them, but dont take it out on yourself.",1
"as nice as she might seem, theres always the possibility that she wouldnt appreciate the biggest help you could give, it has nothing to do with how you are.",1
"besides, caring enough for other people to help them out is one of the most honorable things you can do, not only you deserve to live but you deserve to live happily.",1
you are in serious danger otherwise.,1
if i get away with it i will live on and be more happydont be so sure about that.,1
you know you are not   so we have to learn to have a clear mind or at least act like we do no matter what.,1
"if you did that, i guarantee nothing good will come out.",1
"we all get bad urges sometimes, but resisting them is what keeps us alive and many times makes us stronger in some sense.",1
please dont do anything you could regret.,1
"your life, as well as everyone elses, has a lot of value.",1
"even if you dont feel it at this moment, it will hit you at some point.",1
"many of us know how that numbness is, the best thing to do seems to be just being nice even if you dont feel like it, if you dont do good at least dont load your conscience with bad things.",1
"get help, do as much as you can to change your thinking for the better.",1
"youll pull through, just keep on.",1
you did right by applying for a job.,1
"look for more things to do that will force you to meet people, you will eventually find someone nice, good initiative and keep going!",1
"you are on the right path, just stop caring about what douchebags like that are getting, it wont do you any good and theres no point in envying others.",1
"nobody is perfect, he probably wont appreciate what he has, even if he gets what he wants.",1
"improve yourself, love yourself, love your life, and you will be a thousand times happier than that ass.",1
"i had people like him in my life too, its useless to get mad, that way hed be winning.",1
"i dont think either of you have real friends, but im sure he never will.",1
what about getting a simple job to keep you entertained for a bit while still getting the disability ?,1
"its always a sad outcome, dont even consider it.",1
the heat is so fucking attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as well.,1
"you are doing something for yourself, that takes courage.",1
"going from numbness to a hurricane of feelings is a huge shake, nobody enjoys that, but this bit of suffering will seem nothing compared with the joy youll get as the bad feelings fade away.",1
"there are ups and downs so dont rush into thinking you are getting worse when the blues hit you, and the downs will feel long, but every time you are there remember you can only go up.",1
i think i can say im on the way to that.,1
"my story is somewhat similar to friend_of_the_show66, and weighted 176lbs  5 months ago.",1
"im at 165 lbs now but much more built, by seriously doing a sport for the first time in my life, and enjoying it at the same time.",1
"physically, im not where i want to be yet, but feel like im getting there.",1
"in other aspects, well, its all a journey you have to enjoy, some things will make you stronger, some will just fuck you, but all you need is the right motivation.",1
"i havent, totally, but feel like its possible and getting there slowly.",1
"the more you do to get better, the better youll feel.",1
"we always underrate the benefit we will get by doing things for ourselves, so little things can make a big difference actually.",1
i am really interested in reading more about you.,1
yeah like i didnt have stuff to do.,1
like i said in your previous thread:,1
"i think everyone gets some retribution for getting into sw, no matter what do they do in here.",1
"as for myself, ive been pretty bad the last couple of months , and even though i havent seriously considered suicide in over 5 years, the shock of actually thinking of leaving this world sticks with you for a long time.",1
when i started browsing sw i felt so inspired i felt i really had to take part.,1
only a short time ago i acquired the experience and courage to actually post and try to help out .,1
"im far from being a good helper here, and i certainly dont believe i will change anyones life, but im doing my best and this is one of the little things that make me proud of myself, even if done anonymously.",1
"tl;dr, feels a little less bad man.",1
i cant edit my comment for some reason.,1
its amazing how many of us are still hiding.,1
"if we read your post is because we care and its fulfilling to try to help someone like you, because we feel you.",1
"opening your thoughts isnt easy, but you should make it a goal of yours.",1
look for one of the people who love you and pick someone who has been through it.,1
"that person will be surprised, surely, but will completely understand you.",1
"that takes courage to do, but its a great thing to manage to get yourself to do it.",1
"as writngrl said, having written to us is a great thing, you should consider this an achievement somehow.",1
"well, i dont think i know enough to give you an answer but that must always come hundreds of miles before you start planning on taking your life.",1
"and i dont think its , itd actually be a positive thing if you reach that point.",1
"dont feel bad about yourself for what you didnt have with her, its never that , its that you just werent compatible enough, and her leaving you doesnt mean mood he us better than you.",1
"if you work on it, you will meet other girls.",1
"maybe the first girl you see isnt as good for you as your ex, maybe the second isnt either, but you can get there and giving up is not the way to achieve results!",1
"start living for yourself a little more, do things you used to do before, or try other things that interest you.",1
"keep going, the struggle is worth it.",1
settling for what you can getmore like getting what you settle on.,1
"you want to make changes, then tell us a bit more about you lifestyle.",1
there are lots of things for which you should still be living.,1
just because you dont see them right now doesnt mean mood you wont in a while.,1
"if you live alone, maybe it would be a good idea to hide the pills separately, otherwise give them to someone you trust.",1
feel free to pm and please report back.,1
"im not in the states either, south america actually.",1
you are going to find a good way out of this.,1
"if you have any ideas, id like to hear them.",1
"thanks, im glad i could help, your post got me pretty motivated to write something so i just did.",1
this sort of comments are the best things i got from reddit ill pm you soon=,1
"i do think they care, but some people just dont know how to handle this sort of situation.",1
"i could be wrong here, but in my case talking to my parents could cause a wide range of reactions .",1
"do talk to them if you want, but be ready and know that in the desesperation and helplesness, they can react somewhat weirdly.",1
feeling like you are running with your head in a bag right ?,1
"well, some of us can trip and fall, but many will start an uphill race i guess.",1
there is no point in worrying yet!,1
"try to sit back and see your situation from another angle, there are lots of things going through your brain, which is still developing.",1
its not nearly as bad when you see it from a different mindset.,1
dont do things you would regret afterwards.,1
"i have bad mood swings and although i cant really tell how am i doing at the time, it helps to maintain your life while working on the things that bother you.",1
"though im young, i have no material belongings either, not even the computer im writing from nor the bed where i sleep.",1
"and its pretty easy for me to see the bright side of that one, imagine the worries and responsibilities, think about most people in the us, they have lots of things to their names but couldnt pay their debts by selling that stuff.",1
"i love that phrase, and it couldnt be more accurate.",1
"the world is abnormal behavior but good things happen every second, but we have to move forward in order to take advantage of those opportunities.",1
why are you considering suicide ?,1
"at least post your story, nobody here will comment about methods.",1
cuts are supposed to chest pain right ?,1
it wouldnt be normal if they didnt.,1
i stopped going on vacations with my family two years ago because of that.,1
"besides not having fun and almost getting the point to hating them, i lack the phobia, social abilities to meet anyone on a trip, that didnt even cross my mind, so i ended up spending most of the time alone to avoid fighting.",1
"it seems you are being successful in getting yourself together, dont throw it all away for momentary times of weakness.",1
"know that feelings often are based on nothing wrong about ourselves or our lives, learn to ignore those that are irrational .",1
"keep on living, im sure you had a lot of good times the past year, think that youll get more and more of those if you continue with your progress.",1
"you have proven you are strong, now enjoy what youve achieved !",1
waiting for it to get better isnt the shortest path.,1
you have to pick yourself up and do something about your situation while you wait.,1
"please, if you dont do it for yourself do it for us.",1
sorry if i sounded a bit harsh.,1
"in fact, its great to see people trying to get more involved.",1
"thanks for that, but from what we know from proffessionals .",1
the main issue here is giving evil people to contact other people in need with no way for contributors to know about it.,1
"imho the fact that most of us are not proffessionals isnt so important, but making others believe someone will be there 24/7 is, and a considerable one.",1
"i would love to hear more ideas about some way to improve this sw provides, but sticking always to what very experienced users recommended, you have my full support and help.",1
"millions of people are born and die every day, my death is not important.",1
"lots of people are born and die every day, but thats not important.",1
the important part is that your world  is composed of very few people.,1
think about how many births and deaths have happened close yo you or the people who you care about.,1
those are the important ones for you and them.,1
"just take a break, i know you want the thoughts to stop crumbling your mind, but if you really care about them the least you can do is give yourself to think about it some more time.",1
"christmas isnt nearly as important for them as you are, im sure, it doesnt matter what time of the year you choose, it will feel like an unbearable ache to them.",1
"nobody could have noticed about me at that time, and i was very good at hiding it, for better or for worse.",1
though i probably wouldnt be able to tell when someone is there or just having a bad time right at that moment or something like that.,1
"iamaaron, you should seriously consider something like this.",1
"suicide is always an option, living again isnt.",1
"also drug use isnt really harming yourself, now if he was taking pills and alcohol to possibly kill himself then yea.",1
"it does harm, and many times it is an expression of self hate, even if it seems to be just to have a good time.",1
because neither of you can help the other out of their respective emotional lows right now.,1
"sadly, i never lost the hope to support her, to save her without exposing myself, and that idea is so attractive to me i cant leave it behind.",1
"i know people might be fucked up in ways that are not reachable by me, but i want to know that at least i did my best for her.",1
"i dont think ill attempt suicide if she does, but thatd be by far the toughest shit of my life.",1
"i plan on keeping the few friends with whom i can be myself and let the rest drift apart  nice post man, thanks",1
"just click on my username, and in that page therell be a link on the right that says  or something like that with a little envelope next to it.",1
"you can check the responses by clicking on the envelope on top of the page at any time while browsing reddit we can talk here though, i dont mind.",1
"i repeat, im pretty sure i know where you are now, but it will go away in some time, theres no need to take drastic measures.",1
"you want to redeem yourself by doing this, to show those people that you care and that you are sorry, and you feel like thats the best way to prove it.",1
"there are hundreds, thousands of other ways to try to get those people back, and even moving on is far, far better than attempting.",1
"as sqlwitch said, harming yourself will make your mistake even worse.",1
theres only more ache through that door.,1
"if you are unsettled by this whole thing, you care; and if you care, you can do things to redeem yourself.",1
im sure you are a nice person.,1
"i feel im on top of th world at times, and then like the most insignificant piece of shit there is.",1
"the cycles usually start slow, but then it gets to the point where i have 3 or 4 violent mood swings in a day.",1
circumstances almost never help.,1
"when it gets to that point, i end up being so confusion i dont even feel anything at all, im sort of like a psychopath.",1
"trying as hard as i can to think rationally gets me through with little damage to my relationships, but ive been pretending for so many years it sucks.",1
"i wasnt really familiar with that, sorry.",1
how about looking for something abroad or in another state ?,1
"responses can take a while here, sadly, much more than 20 minutes some times.",1
"you have to wait for it to get better with time, and it will eventually.",1
"continue with your daily life, talk to people as often as possible, you might even meet someone better !",1
"sw is here and so am i, you can pm or post at any time, about anything you want to talk about.",1
i am feeling pretty lonely so a bit of talk wouldnt chest pain me .,1
"seriously, just keep on moving and you can contact me at any time.",1
"it is upsetting, but the part that makes me feel more upset is that they seem to be doing this through pm, not comments.",1
"the more reports/messages we get, the faster well be able to handle things like this.",1
"mods cant check all comments before anyone sees them either, so report any suspicious/negative thing you see and well make a decision asap.",1
there must be something you can say about yourself ?,1
you like anime dont you ?,1
you must be in your 20s i guess.,1
"you do have stuff to tell, theres no need to be specific just let me know what is it that you dont like about your life -or yourself- before even planning to do something like that.",1
"you have nothing to loose by talking to us, but you might earn a desire to live.",1
"notice i didnt say  but , it is possible.",1
i want someone to hold me while i hypersomnia.,1
"we all do, and the chance of finding that someone depends on how much you do for reaching that goal that could help you get better.",1
"hey, none of us has answers for everything , we just provide opinions.",1
"if you dont feel like talking about it with him, make the reason clear, really speak your mind because just avoiding the topic might be taken in a negative way by him.",1
"if you honestly tell him its too much for you, hell totally understand i think.",1
"im guessing hes probably under heavy medication, keep that in mind if anything he says or does seems a bit odd.",1
"also people around him are in a stressful situation, their attitudes may seem strange and say things they dont really mean mood.",1
"a couple more updates wouldnt be bad, youre taking it like a champ",1
when and how did you get to this state of mind?,1
"for your sake, i hope they are sleeping.",1
you need not end what hasnt begun.,1
we all live for those of us around us.,1
"we all keep each other sane, and happy to one degree or another despite going through tough times.",1
im not sure this belongs here.,1
what kind of guidance are you looking for?,1
i know the easiest way to die.,1
giving up is not what you really want to do.,1
"you came here for support, because there is a part of you that doesnt want this.",1
think about that part and dont give in to the other side; the suicidal side.,1
part of dealing with ache is taking some stress in some fashions.,1
"however, the saying goes that there is always someone who has a worse situation.",1
"there are children being used as currency in some countries, taken from their homes and sold like a commodity.",1
"i dont use this example to shed light on the bad in the world, but only to look at it from a different perspective.",1
"you are alive, have a home, and food at the ready.",1
you already live better than a big portion of the rest of the world.,1
"things may have been bad at some point in the past, present, and probably future.",1
"but its only when you make a proactive point to make yourself happy will things change, and only if you want them to change.",1
which is why therapy does not work well for some people.,1
"some people go because they are told, and not because they actively want to better themselves.",1
"if you want to actually better yourself, which i know you do as you posted here for help.",1
i wont give you any other advice than to stand up for yourself and dont look so down on yourself.,1
"for all you know, your ache could have saved someones life.",1
"dont take this as a complement or joust, take this as a piece of mind that everything really does have a silver lining.",1
stay strong and remember to value yourself at the level you want to be.,1
"calling 911 was the correct answer, and im glad so many people told you to.",1
"she will probably be anger at you for this, but do not let it bring you down.",1
"realize you did the best thing you could ever do for her, and she will see that sooner or later.",1
"also, the comments she is making towards you is to get your attention to see if you care.",1
"or is an actual threat, so you definitely had reason to suspect both.",1
"you made the right call, good job.",1
"i respect your ideals on the subject, but in our culture its not accepted because we are selfish as well.",1
"i more see this situation as not a imminent, painful, terminal disease however.",1
things that his patients suffered.,1
the only disease you are suffering is that of the bane of mankind and all it seems to lack.,1
the only reason it is lacking is because you are not fulfilling all that it can be.,1
"i know youre not looking for the advice on how to stay or be happy, but its all too common that life passes through the fingertips due to a lack of push to push your life to its full potential.",1
i hope you see the good thats in you.,1
the pleasure is mine; knowing you care about your friends.,1
you just said your friend would blame herself.,1
what makes you think youre evil?,1
talking it out was a good choice.,1
i am happy you made this choice.,1
"i agree though, that sometimes things seem too good to be true and so you are comparing them to your past life, which rekindles how you used to feel.",1
"these feelings will come and go in your life, unfortunately.",1
but just look at your success and your potential and you wont let the downward slope bring you all the way down the mountain.,1
it sounds like youve lived the life that most over weight kids strive for.,1
"you got healthy, in shape, friends, and attractive.",1
you just showed right there that with determination you can get to a state of feeling good about your body.,1
"but judging by your lack of self confidence, i wonder if you did it for yourself, and not just peer acceptance.",1
"the world has so many opportunities and long term, life changing possibilities that it would be a waste to through it all away.",1
whats stopping you from being fat and happy?,1

"if you dont violate her trust, she may not have a life anymore.",1
it sounds like you were talked into college and not a general want to go.,1
"as for your father, the situation is sticky.",1
"he may not realize it, or you for that matter, that his unwilling to live is not helping you succeed and become the person you and him want you to be.",1
"as for your mother, i can only ask you talk to her.",1
now that youre 19 it may be best to look at finding a stable job and just moving out.,1
the environment is very bad for your current life feelings.,1
im glad that this is unlike you to come here and ask for help.,1
there are many of us who are here to help and who want to help.,1
"that being said, we can only help as much as you want to let us.",1
so i begin by asking you where you are in your life right now.,1
what about life with your boyfriend?,1
"if you dont want to reply directly, i will be happy to talk in pms.",1
"just remember that no one is there to judge you, or has a right to.",1
youve made the first step towards getting better by coming here.,1
think of something youve always wanted to do and go do it.,1
what has lead to these feelings?,1
could it be that you do not understand how you feel because its a different lifestyle you have now?,1
its okay and im glad youre seeing things differently.,1
im sorry it came off that way.,1
have you tried joining your local gay community groups?,1
"there are likely tons of opportunities for friendships, and relationships.",1
as well as feeling a whole lot better about yourself.,1
you wont need to hide and you wont need to feel like an outcast.,1
i was in a similar situation at your age.,1
"you have a full life ahead of you, no matter what happens between your parents.",1
"being in a similar situation, your parents might lash out at each other and carry the anger towards yourself.",1
"ignore it as they dont really mean mood it, or if you have to, call the authorities.",1
"its good to laugh, despite it being a very sad laugh.",1
the point of life to some is amassing fortunes.,1
"to others, its dedicating their life to help others for little to no pay at all.",1
im not telling you to pack your bags and to move to africa.,1
"you say you enjoy weed, wow, and parties.",1
its a lot more common than you may think.,1
so dont take it as a negative in any sense of the word.,1
"do whatever makes you happy, and disregard what others say.",1
"and judging by your statements, things have gotten slightly better?",1
have you considered going to an aa meeting?,1
there are plenty of resources that you could attend that would help you.,1

our job here is to mentor and talk people out of suicide.,1
we can only help you if you are willing to accept the help.,1
i dont want to see this happen to you and i hope the others on this subreddit feel the same and dont tempt your ill state of thought.,1
i feel were at two conflicting points here.,1
"i wasnt advocating you to get fat, just more so to live care free and if you get fat, then oh well.",1
the exercise didnt help you be happy.,1
"im not sure what you want to hear, but i hope you find a way to see the beauty in the darkness of life.",1
giving yourself permission for what?,1
dont think like that.,1
you have many things that you might not even see.,1
its hard to be positive at times and im not going to push that on you.,1
"that being said, photography is a wonderful thing.",1
maybe starting a blog or a tumblr will help you understand your potential.,1

care to explain what the problem is?,1
"from what i know, there are clicks and groups of the sorts that find their own identity.",1

"in agreeance with  i suggest that you dont try to relate, you dont try to push, and dont try to tell her how bad it is.",1
that can only fuel their desire to self inflict.,1
"consider just listening, and when she asks questions, find a sedated state way of putting it.",1
"unless it become a life threatening issue, avoid reporting it and keep what you hear to yourself and only you.",1

this situation is all too common.,1
"do you find your friends not as interested as they have more of a phobia, social life and just less time to socialize, and are drifting away due to differences in life styles?",1
im not going to argue for or against the statement that life is meaningless.,1
i once thought these same things.,1
its hard to grasp just how much not being there would crush the world around you.,1
"whether or not you believe me, there are those who care but just dont have words to share with you.",1
"if you really want to make life less meaningless, find something that helps one person a day in a positive way.",1
"if you find yourself making others happy, you may find a way yourself to sit down at the end of the day and feel good about yourself.",1
"from there, it is your own journey.",1
"the difference though, is that unexpected death and purposeful death are two different games.",1
"sudden death would not be your will, and they would still cope with the ache of the loss.",1
pushing your own death will make them regret not being there for you more and cause them more ache in that of which they could not help.,1
telling them is just a smack in the face.,1
a selfish and hurtful way of saying that they are not worth it.,1

"back in october/early november, i think it was the girlfriend that he didnt mention until theyd been dating for several weeks .",1
"now theyve broken up, apparently recently, and nows the first time ive brought it up since things were looking better in a relationship.",1
"hes had significant problems with his family, hes just starting a new job that he hates already, and hes just broken up with the girlfriend.",1
its just a matter of trying to get him motivated enough to actually do it.,1
"i go home next week, though that will still put us 250 miles apart.",1
well see what happens while im home.,1
"we live quite far apart currently, so i dont really know who he talks to.",1
im glad to hear that this is what i should be doing.,1
things have been pretty shit for him recently.,1
ive tried the usual stuff that i can do.,1
words about how much i care what happens to him.,1
"ive been trying to get him to move out of the area where depressed mood things have happened recently, but hes been hesitant to do so.",1
do you have any younger siblings?,1
"if you do, you have to stay alive for them, because if your dad is doing this to you, he sure as hell will do it to them, too.",1
they need you to be doing whatever you can  to stop this from happening to all of you.,1
"if you dont, thats by no means a license to kill yourself.",1
document everything to the best of your ability in writing and if possible with visuals  and go to the police and cps with it.,1
"if theres a teacher or friend you trust with this, they can be an extremely valuable resource to you and can help you get out of this situation and to a safe place.",1

"op probably lives in the us, where most people learn to drive in their mid-teens.",1
"listen, you dont seem like you really want to do this.",1
all of the reasons youve listen for wanting to commit suicide can be resolved somehow .,1
"you can work on the problems youre having with drugs and hypersomnia and your parents, and trust me, one day something will come along that will improve your outlook on the future.",1
do you want to know what happened to me?,1
for a long time i felt really directionless and lost.,1
"i was happy, or at least content most of the time, but i had no passion for anything.",1
"i had no drive, nor any idea of what i wanted my future to look like.",1
for a while i mostly just kept going because it seemed like the thing to do.,1
suddenly there were mountains to climb and goals to achieve; new things to see and do and learn about.,1
"now its something i couldnt live without and i plan to spend the rest of my life, as long as it may be, exploring the mountains and the forests, because its where i feel at home.",1
you never know when something like this will come into your life.,1
"a lot of things change very quickly when youre fifteen, i remember, im not much older than you myself.",1
i can almost guarantee you that something will come along in the next year or two that will really make you really want to live--it does for almost everybody around our age.,1
"you said you have good friends and good relationships--thats half the battle, you know.",1
throw yourself into your relationships with your friends  and see what comes out.,1
build on the friendships you already have.,1
live for them if you have to until you find your own something to live for.,1
"i cant really tell you what it will be or where to look for it, but looking through your friends is far from the worst place to start.",1
go out and do things you enjoy doing together and see what new things you find.,1
"i wasnt suicidal, but its what revealed my passion to me.",1
"if you want, please send me a private message.",1
"ill be around a little while longer tonight, and in the morning as well.",1
"when it came to projects and fund raisers, the best thing for me is to just tackle things one at a time.",1
dont let yourself get overwhelmed by a dozen things to do--push 11 out of your head until you finish the most pressing one.,1
"in future, op, you have to learn to say  sometimes, and that its okay to do so.",1
"i was in a similar situation at certain points in drug abuse school when i felt like i was drowning in a sea of commitments, both ones that i did and did not ask for.",1
a big part of the problem was that i over-committed myself to things.,1
it took me a long time to learn to turn down projects or volunteer work or what-have-you when i had too much on my plate at the moment.,1
"its okay to turn down a project if you feel stretched beyond your limit, another will be along in no time; and if you still feel like you have to much to do, flip em the bird and say no to that one, too .",1
"once you learn to manage your projects and get a sense for the amount of work you can comfortable handle, trust me, things will get better.",1
"if you went to someone you trusted and confided in them and asked them to help you, part of the implicit bargain  is that it remains between the two of you.",1
"hell, you can even explicitly ask them not to speak about it to anyone else.",1
"most people understand this type of phobia, social contract well and will keep it.",1
"please speak to someone, anyone, about this.",1
"i know im a little late to the party, but i was out all morning and only just got back to my computer.",1
im glad to hear your decision.,1
like i said in another comment.,1
"if you ever want to talk, feel free to pm me.",1
i dont think you really want to die.,1
"if you really did, if all of you really did, you wouldnt have come here.",1
theres at least a part of you that still wants to live.,1
"that part of you brought you here, hoping to find help.",1
"theres a reason for you to live, im sure of it.",1
"you may not have found it yet, but there is one out there for you.",1
theres someone to love; something to love doing; a way to bring meaning into your life.,1
i promise theres something for you in this world.,1
"it may not be obvious or easy to see, but it is there.",1
i think youre being downvoted because people felt it was obvious that op was not yet in japan.,1
those people are not your parents.,1
"even if they birthed you and raised you, no  parent would ever tell their child to kill themselves.",1
theyre not worth your time and certainly not worth your life.,1
"im not sure im the best one to help you--there are many other more capable people here than me--but i saw that the only comment on this post besides your own is a worthless, piece of shit troll and i wanted to tell you that he knows nothing.",1
"i dont think youre trash, and i definitely dont think you should kill yourself.",1
i spent the latter part of my day together getting signatures to promote a new therapy club on campus for people in situations similar or maybe even in worse situations.,1

"youre so damn smart like her, yet you have something she didnt, a real connection with people.",1
"i could literally count on my hands te number of times i wished she had a connection with somebody who fueled her, kept her going.",1
why in the fucking world would you give up?,1
youre so fucking young god i wish i was that age.,1
"i would go to school again and instead of doing the major my parents forced me into, id major in english ad write and read ad share my thoughts in shakespeare and fittz and scott and blake and taylor etc.",1
youre spoiled to think life doesnt offer anything.,1
keep your head drug abuse and use that superior knowledge of yours to do something amazing.,1
"i, we, every single person youve met before knows you can do it.",1
lets go conquer fucking mental depression together.,1

"ive got all the band-aids youll ever need, man.",1
go out there and get messy again.,1
every single comment helps so much.,1
"i wish i could be in your shoes, take the ache for you, and let you experience some of my joy for a second so that, without explanation, you understood how i overcame my grief, anguish, turmoils, and started realizing what real happiness was.",1
"or, perhaps, you would know that there is always somebody out there who understands.",1
i know how how everyday feels.,1
the sad mood that awaits with every ticking second pummels down on your mood; happiness seems like a far-reaching goal that doesnt even render worth the chase anymore.,1
"depression overcomes you in waves, followed by thoughts of parents, friends, possible moments of life where you are expected to be alive for.",1
nothing makes sense other than the cold splash of reality that.,1
stuck somewhere and you cant see the way out.,1
wishing you had a hand to hold onto.,1
"but he ventricular dysfunction, left.",1
i need somebodys hand so much.,1
"i never ventricular dysfunction, left the cave.",1
"maybe along the way, we can pick up the others.",1
the ache that acts in reverberation through the entire body hurts.,1
"it knocks some of my friends down, too.",1
"for me, its people like you.",1
seeing them smile every so often even when theyre frowning 90% of the time is more than enough to make my body shake with excitement.,1
"with the anticipation that if theyre smiling every so often, that means there is something that they still respond to.",1
still find themselves alive in spirit to move to.,1
"i remember her hand touching mine and the warmth that flowed from her body to mine, channeled up to my heart, wrapping it, and sending it back to the other hand, down to the earth.",1
and the same emotional connection remains.,1
ushering an entire new warmth.,1
there will be moments of severe anxiety.,1
"there will be those moments where youll stop, question yourself, and feel sluggish to even try to remember where you were going or what you were doing.",1
your veins and arteries carry your life force.,1
your existence becomes needed.,1
"youre a variable in this equation, called happiness.",1
it may be incredibly selfish but its so important that you smile.,1
and give others a reason to do the same.,1
"it took me months to recover from my break-up with the only person i ever felt love for; it was the longest, cruelest three months of my life.",1
suicide was a constant contemplation.,1
i reached out to this community after two months of frustration and the very first post i received offered a chance to talk.,1
i had to find pace of speed in the marathon and i found some people along the way that had the same pace i did!,1
we were just friends on the path of happiness and we happened to be on the same stride.,1
trust me; theyre waiting for you to join them.,1
"we will crying reflex, abnormal when you crying reflex, abnormal.",1
"we will run with you, because as much as you need us, we need you just as much, if not more.",1

kudos to those taking up the offer; extending a hand is always a brave thing to do.,1

"i comforted her from 3000 miles away and i made every effort i could to surprise her to feats to cheer her up, put a smile on her face, or make her laugh.",1
i was a damn happy trooper before i got into this shit.,1
i apologised for anything ive ever done to chest pain her and she cried saying she was sorry for letting me go like this.,1
"and i didnt crying reflex, abnormal.",1
"i didnt crying reflex, abnormal for the last two days.",1
but just thirty minutes ago i cried like a damn baby.,1
i cried for so long and hard and i looked at myself in the mirror.,1
and now im subscribed to suicide watch and r/mental depression.,1
and im reading stories like this and im thinking to myself; maybe it isnt so bad.,1
it isnt going to kill me nor is it going to ruin my life.,1
that weirdness youre describing about yourself?,1

"work on your chest/back on mondays, your legs on tuesday, your arms/shoulders on wednesday, and try to run on thursdays.",1
ill make a fucking account for you and ill sign up and ill flirt with girls and get them all excited to see you&lt; mother fucker  woooooo.,1
dont take my advice passively.,1
ive been where youve been  and ive understood the idea of a meaningless life so damn intimately.,1
but some anonymous people reach out to me and i cant fucking be idle while there are others who may be in worse situations but without any appropriate outlet.,1
thats why im starting a club at my school to give a voice to those who dont have one.,1
im doing something with my mental depression.,1
"if you want, ill give you my phone number and you give me a call.",1
because im proud to have a person like you consider me a friend and trust me enough.,1
im proud to live a life where total strangers trust me.,1
"that to me, is more humbling than anything gift in the universe.",1
"every time you fuck up, we all fuck up.",1
"every time you accomplish something, however minor, we all feel the damn pride of accomplishment.",1
"words may be cheap in some context, but from reading yours, i could already surmise the type of man who could write such words, and that mans pure awesome.",1
so stop looking at your problems as  but as temporary challenges blocking you from happiness.,1
"what that happiness is, ive no idea, but i can tell you that my happiness sometimes is the joy of being able to get coffee and being able to say  to random strangers on the street and fully get a  back.",1
youre in a position where you have enough financial abilities and freedom to do something amazing.,1
"i always wanted the ability to do cosplay, but im currently attending school and i dont have the time nor the money to invest in such an endeavor.",1
"you, my fine sir, you are amazing in every way im not.",1
dont be afraid to reach your hand out there.,1
"if you want an experience, meetup.",1
"unless you want to be where you are your entire life, you have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations and make that situations so damn comfortable, you keep going back.",1
"some people are destined to be great/amazing fathers, mothers, brothers, sister, ceos, neighborhood gossip, etc.",1
"you have the ability to be amazing in every single way you want; dont ruin that possibility by comparing yourself to some phobia, social addicts who get nothing but temporary enjoyment out of life.",1
"personally, i find myself absolutely happy when im sitting with a friend on sunday at some obscure cafe playing chess and sipping coffee.",1
put yourself in an uncomfortable situation and make it so damn comfortable.,1
"eventually, theyll talk back and.",1
youve made a marker in the universe.,1
pm me if ever youre looking for somebody to talk to.,1
"besides, youve more wisdom than i do.",1
i wont shy away from that learning experience.,1
why are you in love with a girl that cheated on her boyfriend?,1
"i dont see anything wrong with you and kate being together, but from experience ive understood that women on the rebound tend to be only emotionally attached and not mentally attached.",1
"give her time and if after she sobers up from the entire ordeal she still wants you, then you know that truly, its her desire and not her emotional need.",1
apologize to adam and be on with it.,1
"ive seen many cases where friends ruin their friendship over attractive women, whom, in the end werent even a great reason for such breakage.",1
"im not against kate nor am i against you, but i think what happened to adam was a huge violation of his trust.",1
"hes the victim in this, not you or kate.",1
"you dont owe adam anything, but take a long look at yourself and ask yourself if youre the person you want to be.",1
"like gandhi once said,  its an over-used quote, but there is much truth in it.",1
"she couldve had the scruples to at least break up with adam before having intercourse with you, but she chose not to.",1
"personally, i fear any woman that can do that without remorse.",1
"and youve no reason to be sad, mate.",1
"youre a good guy who just had sex, though at a cost.",1
cheer up and start loving yourself no matter what.,1
youre the first person in a while to even comment on my writing and not my content.,1
"it still fucking hurts, but after yesterday, after the explosion of my painful throe, i feel so much better.",1
i felt like my entire cynicism from life just melted and i have a new purpose.,1
im trying to create a club at my school thatll promote a therapeutic environment for anybody and everybody.,1
"i dont want anybody to go through what i did and not have a place to let it off their shoulders, chest, head, etc.",1
your comment alone makes me sigh with gratitude.,1
you obviously care for your mother quite deeply.,1
"living without her after what youve been through must be a terrifying thought, but do you really think this is what she would want?",1
"what would you say is the root cause of this feeling, then?",1
or is it something you arent entirely aware of?,1
"in that case, im sorry - i didnt mean mood to lean too heavily toward that option.",1
or did your post cover pretty much everything?,1
what makes you feel so disgusting and ashamed?,1
are your friends or peers homophobic?,1
do you really think youre being needy to ask her for help in this situation?,1
"if she came to you with something like this, would you think she was being overly dependent?",1
"were you deeply looking forward to having children, or do you just consider homosexuality to be unnatural?",1
"whether or not you can see it, or others acknowledge it, you are here, and you do have value.",1
"even if you feel you really do have nobody to turn to, or that nobody cares for you, were still here to listen.",1
"and if you decide to leave, know that even if its only us here at sw, you will be missed.",1
"have you tried talking to your girlfriend about how you feel, though?",1
"if she agreed to be in a relationship with you, she must care about you to some extent.",1
do you really think she would ignore you if you told her what you were going through?,1
"i dont know what youve been through, or whats lead you to such a steadfast certainty that any life you would lead would be unconditionally horrible, but there is one thing i do know.",1
"for all our knowledge - our instant, worldwide communication network, our pocket-sized libraries, our mars rovers - nobody can know the future.",1
"people have been trying to find methods of looking into the future for millennia, but the reason it still eludes us even as we take our first steps on the red world is because, by its nature, the future represents limitless possibility.",1
"whether or not you believe it in this moment of despair, there are paths that can lead you to happiness.",1
"and you have the power to forge your own path - after all, the greatest influence on your future is your own decisions.",1
"tomorrow could be an amazing day - a day of peace, and encouragement - and all you have to do is choose to make it one.",1
"in fact, it might be a great day even if you dont choose to make anything of it.",1
i dont know the future either.,1
so you feel lonely despite having friends because you feel none of your relationships with them are genuine?,1
odds are fair that youre at least decent at something.,1
"but to be really good at something, you have to practice a lot, and give yourself some time to improve.",1
"you must have some interests, though.",1
"they dont necessarily have to relate to your education, or a career path.",1
why do you feel so hateful toward yourself?,1
what makes you think that you dont deserve these things?,1
"is it because of anything specific, or have you just felt emotional since your delivery?",1
do you think you might feel better if you were able to get some rest?,1
i know firsthand how much hypersomnia deprivation can tangle your thoughts and feelings.,1
"i cant imagine how much pressure the idea of motherhood must be, especially since it seems as though the father isnt part of the picture.",1
you said yourself that youre surrounded by people who care for you.,1
how do you think this would affect them?,1
do you honestly think ending your own life will really make life happier for any of them?,1
why do you feel you cant discuss these things with your friends?,1
"from your comment, it seems like theyre rather concerned already, and they would probably be more than willing to help you.",1
"if you cant bring yourself to do it, no matter the reason, there are always people you can talk to.",1
"we at sw are always willing to listen, and help you work through this.",1
im sure there are other counselors you could contact as well.,1
nobody deserves this kind of death.,1
"im hardly a psychiatric expert, but even if it is purely founded on a chemical imbalance , understanding that these feelings of sadness and self-loathing have little to no external source could help her overcome this in a number of ways.",1
"besides, support groups and other non-medical therapeutic options are still used as methods to address and treat postpartum depression.",1
"as i said, im not an expert, so you could very well be right, but ive never known trying to understand ones feelings and their causes as being as unhelpful as you seem to suggest.",1
"perhaps, when all is said and done, antidepressants are the answer, but as a rule i dont personally recommend people to things that alter their brain chemistry as the first resort, considering how much we still dont understand about the human brain and its chemical operations.",1
thats sad but i can see how you could feel that way.,1
its like half your team is quitting on you and dumping all their extra emotional baggage for you to carry but you dont need that shit and can carry on stronger by letting it go.,1
"i know that feeling man but i hear you have some good hash in india, the next time you want to relax smoke or eat some and let things work themselves out.",1
"hang out with her and chill, let her talk or not, hide her pills.",1
this might be okay because it sounds like you have some specific problems that you need to talk about.,1
so if you have some shit that you need to get off your chest this is a good place to get some perspective .,1
"we just gotta do it one day at a time, take care of today, no need to anxiety about a made up future.",1
im no doctor but i do know people have been soothing their broken hearts with alcohol for hundreds of years so i wouldnt say its automatically a sign of a problem.,1
trying to care for him too much will just confuse his emotions even more.,1
first off thank you for coming here to talk about it.,1
it can be very scary to think of things like this and easy to feel like the walls are closing in around you and there is no one else in the room with you.,1
i am very sorry for your loss.,1
it can be easy to think about death when it visits someone close to you.,1
"it affects everyone differently, so i wouldnt take what the other friend said to heart.",1
the important thing here is that you want to feel different.,1
"feeling different and making those thoughts go away is not something that is likely to happen right away, so dont beat up on yourself for not being able to suddenly feel better.",1
"you experienced a loss, and that is a difficult thing to deal with.",1
"just try to remember that you are not alone, and that you are not a bad person because someone said so in anger.",1
"it can be difficult not to dwell on things like this, and sometimes trying specifically not to dwell on them can just make you think about it more.",1
i have found that the easiest way to stop thinking poorly of yourself is to get busy.,1
when your mind is focused on a task it has much less room to think negatively.,1
"add to that, working on a task leads to finishing a task, which leads to a feeling of achievement which can also help you to feel better.",1
i gotta agree with you that sometimes i wish i could just be a dick too.,1
it comes naturally to so many though that i feel like its not even a skill anymore.,1
any better since posting this earlier today?,1
"i dont know how much it means to you, but from the way you wrote you seem like a pretty great person.",1
"i personally admire the way you think of many other people, talking about blood donation and covering your roomate.",1
i think you are around a lot of people that dont recognize your value.,1
remember that mental depression is not a logical disease.,1
it doesnt necessarily come from your surroundings.,1
there is no need to put yourself under the extra pressure of being expected to be happy.,1
you sound like you have a lot on your plate.,1
"for what its worth, you seem like an awesome person to be around.",1
"i dont really know how good i am at cheering people up, but you have convinced me to donate blood more often .",1
i hope things start looking up for you.,1
its a good way to get out your stream of consciousness.,1
thats a ache in the ass feat that i am not going to be able to do.,1
"second, not official medical advice, i would definitely talk to your psychiatrist and therapist about this.",1
"if they send you to the hospital, its because thats what they sincerely think will benefit you.",1
there you can receive more specialized care and perhaps medications that will help you out.,1
"if you hide things it is a lot harder to give you the help you need, so try to be as open as possible.",1
this is what i believe i would personally do if i were in this situation.,1
i hope things work out for you.,1
im just going to focus on one part of what you said here.,1
"you said that you spend most of your time in the house while your friends go out, and thats contributing to making you feel crappy about yourself.",1
"it would be a pretty sudden and rough transition to force yourself to go out with your friends, so maybe a nice middle ground would be to make some friends on here!",1
maybe some people you can talk to here can help you boost your self esteem so that you feel more comfortable and  so to speak.,1
ill start by introducing myself:,1
i am 21 and in my junior year at college for an it degree!,1
"i started with chemistry, but the program here really got me down and i ended up stalling for awhile and feeling like crap for a few years, so someone convinced me to switch.",1
"my middle name is tyler, which is a pretty decent name i guess.",1
just in time for the holocaust!,1
damn thats some bad luck isnt it?,1
"anyway she noped the fuck out of there, and here i am 80 years later.",1
"the point of that story, i guess, is that i didnt really have a point while writing it, but now that i look at it, she was in a depressed mood situation but just kept chugging along.",1
hope some of this rambling helps you feel a little better about yourself.,1
it takes a lot of courage to talk about how you feel on the inside.,1
dont anxiety about comparing yourself to others.,1
"you are who you are, and i think you are beautiful.",1
no need to let anyone tell you otherwise.,1
a lot of people are dicks and prefer to advance in life by putting others down instead of elevating themselves.,1
maybe it will help you out to talk to someone who is naturally calm.,1
"i have always found that simply by talking to someone who is calm, the effect spreads a little bit.",1
"it may not be much, but i think it definitely helps.",1
"so, for starters, how long have you felt this way?",1
"well first and foremost, you are absolutely doing the right thing by posting this.",1
"you obviously care about him and clearly want to help him get better, you seem to mostly just be torn on how to best help him.",1
"in my humble opinion, i would probably go and tell his parents because it will probably be easier to get him help than for you to do it.",1
"im here to talk for a bit if youd like to pm me, but until then think of this:",1
"if youre worried about him being anger if/when you tell his parents, its infinitely better to have an anger friend than having the possibility of losing one.",1
"the shittier your life seems to be now, imagine how much more satisfying it will feel when you pull through it all.",1
"life sucks at times, but it will get better.",1
"if you havent already talk to your professors, especially the one for the capstone course, he/she might be able to help you out and pass so you can graduate sooner rather than later.",1
"also, talk with your wife about the courses and how youre doing, things might not be a bleak as they seem.",1
"perhaps i dont understand how bad your life is, but i can nearly guarantee you that there will be effects from your death.",1
"whether you die naturally in 60 years or otherwise, there will be effects from your life ending.",1
"forget about death though, think about life:",1
think about all of the wonderful things you have got to look forward to.,1
"think of when you get a job, how satisfying that first paycheck will feel.",1
think of how great it will feel to know that you will go so far from where you are now.,1
let them know the situation youre in and let them know youre looking for a job.,1
"if they are good and honest people, ill be damned if they dont give you a break on that.",1
"you seem like a good person, the world needs more of them, not less.",1
would you like to talk with me for a bit?,1
"im a fellow middle child for one thing, and ive had my share of issues with my family as well.",1
"ill be here for a while, so if youd like to talk, just pm me, ill be here for a while.",1
"if it was fun writing it all out, imagine trying to actually make some of it happen.",1
"now good luck getting horizon rebuilt, but some of those things are reachable goals that will likely attention deficit disorder a sense of purpose to your life.",1
"learning about engines, in fact, most learning can be done online for free just by poking around youtube and some other sites.",1
"learning cpr can be done pretty easily, as far as i know it takes a few hours on a weekend.",1
might i ask what you are/were getting your degree in?,1
youre really going to do this on a suicide prevention post?,1
"i know you said how much you hated talking to therapists, but perhaps you would feel differently about talking to a regular person?",1
ill be here for a while if youd like to pm me.,1
would you like to talk for a bit?,1
"you seem like a good person, the world needs more of those, not less.",1
"were a nice lot here, so unless youre looking for some cooking recipes we can probably help you out, or at least refer you to someone that can :",1
"imagine everything in your life has been paid for, housing, transportation etc.",1
what would you do with your time/money/passion?,1
all im saying is keep searching.,1
"death is forever, so try your best to enjoy the short time we have on this earth.",1
"trust me, ive had multiple points in my life where i thought suicide was the answer, but you have to remember the good in your life.",1
everybody has something good that has happened in their life.,1
"but, when those moments occur, you remember why life is awesome.",1
trudge through the shit and allow life to surprise you again.,1
"it will happen, i promise you that.",1
"were all going to die at some point, so why not just wait and see what life has in store for you?",1
im going to keep this as short &amp; sweet as possible.,1
dont live your life for others.,1
be selfish and find out what makes you tick.,1
"find out who you really are , because it sounds to me like youre living your life seeking love / approval from others.",1
stop giving a shit about what people think / say about you.,1
find what makes you happy in this world.,1
"even if its only the smallest bit of happiness, pursue it to the fullest.",1
life is a precious gift and shouldnt be taken for granted.,1
live for the simple pleasures in life.,1
those are just a few examples of what i mean.,1
"i have no idea if those will actually resonate with you, but you get the point.",1
the sheer beauty of life &amp; the possibility that things can change in the blink of an eye is what always keeps me going.,1
"anything thats worthwhile in this life, requires perseverance to obtain.",1
"youve been given the gift of life, dont waste it, change it.",1
"if youre not happy with it, never give up, because you can always change it.",1
dont compare your life to the successes of others.,1
"be true to you, and who you really are.",1
the challenges in our lives shape who / what we become.,1
"be brave, be strong, and most importantly, hold on.",1
"ultimately, youre going to do what you want to do.",1
"and, youre going to view the world the way you want to see it.",1
it felt relevant to what you just said in your last comment.,1
how long have you had these thoughts?,1
"like, what can she tell from that recording about your mom?",1
"check our sidebar, and let her know it wasnt her fault.",1
"if it comes down to it, you will have to have her interned, but that way she wont be able to chest pain herself anymore.",1
"i dont know if anyones already asked this, but have you told anyone about suicide?",1
where is the ache coming from?,1
"i might go to bed soon, but i will reply as soon as i get the chance.",1
"hey, i dont know if its mean mood of me to ask, but was your mom like that before your dad passed away?",1
or were you too young to remember?,1
would it be okay with you to write what your previous post said?,1
talk to your doctor about this if you havent.,1
i think reddit has a transgender community.,1
"might be worth checking out, see if their stories can help.",1
"and also, fuck your family in the ass with a cactus.",1
it shouldnt matter if youre transgender or not.,1
"but if you go, there is also the chance youll get better.",1
"i gotta ask, what do you mean mood it stays with you?",1
"i know, thats why i dont want you to anxiety about the future.",1
have you ever talked to a doctor about these thoughts?,1
"basically, she knows her alcoholism is a huge problem, and no ones really bothered to mention it to her but you.",1
"hence, she feels like shell only screw up your life.",1
of course youll have happy days.,1
"but if youre having thoughts of suicide, you should totally tell your family.",1
they should be understanding enough that theyll comfort you and maybe you can start looking for ways to get rid of those thoughts and be happy.,1
"hey, please tel me youre still there.",1
you cant base your value on someone else.,1
"ah, see we were gonna have a mock one, just the two of us, but then cheated on me.",1
"i think you had the right intention, but your dad clearly isnt gonna be much help.",1
do you know someone else you can trust with this?,1
"even if you dont do the same things i do, i still want to show others theres another way.",1
"bro, i get the hippy part, but if theres a way you can get better, dont you think you should give it a try anyway?",1
"dealing with anxiety mental depression isnt easy to begin with, but being loaded with all this stuff in a short amount of time will make it worse.",1
im gad youre still replying to comments.,1
that part about your mom telling you to cut is.,1
"youre probably exhaustion of answering this, but whats wrong?",1
"bro, no girl is worth your life.",1
"a concussion is serious business, and you should definitely find someone willing to treat you.",1
"i dont know, i think you might like it.",1
"you dont have to be specific, but it sounds from what you wrote that you cant do something you loved because you cant stop thinking about suicide.",1
were here if you need to talk.,1
"you definitely have a future, if youve had a past.",1
but when youre depressed mood its hard to see into the future.,1
did you tell your doctor you stopped?,1
"jesus fuck, sue that disturbance in mood and put her in jail.",1
"i mean mood, can you really say for sure theyre better off without you?",1
is his job doing something illegal?,1
"we care about you op, we know suicidal thoughts arent a joke.",1
"im pretty sure if someone burned your house down, you wouldnt be happy either.",1
"op, i always say btches aint shit, but the same applies the other way.",1
"like intellechy said, feel what you need to feel, but please remember that break ups are really hard to deal with.",1
im glad to hear youre doing much better.,1
so i take it youve talked to them before about your mental depression?,1
"she told me her brother in law passed away, and how her sister was always relying on him to do a lot of things.",1
youre far more special than you think.,1
have you talked to anyone about this?,1
"i cant, he lives in a different country than me.",1
"oh, dude, you should totally save me some pokemon for trading.",1
"you need help, just like any other human would.",1
"because rather than have a bullet in your head, we could find ways for you to get better.",1
"for example, talking to your doctor about your suicidal thoughts.",1
"if it means anything, im glad youre still alive, and i hope you will get better.",1
"i just wanted to remind you that you can be happy, i guess?",1
"girl, i know how that feels, trust me.",1
"break ups arent easy, but what youre experiencing is completely normal, ok?",1
itd be illogical to not miss anyone if you loved them but then separated.,1
or the more logical thing would be that there wasnt love involved.,1
you gotta love yourself in order for others to do the same.,1
_thats_ how you catch a nice guy.,1
but we do give a fuck about you.,1
"that being said, its fucked up to tell your kid theyre a failure.",1
"wait, did you actually sign to join?",1
"i lost a friend to suicide too, a few years back.",1
i feel as if i should congratulate you on leaving an abusive relationship.,1
a lot of people that should dont.,1
/r/stopsmoking sounds like a good place to start.,1
"im not sure about coping mechanisms, but  might give you something to think about.",1
you could also ask /r/iwanttolearn how to break that habit.,1
"you are not a freak, but honestly, the guy you were with sounds like it.",1
have you told him that you want to kill yourself and why?,1
"basically, theyre like aloe, they hold water and they come in these abnormal behavior shapes and colors and theyre overall really pretty.",1
"ive been cheated on, but i had to pretend everything was alright for her sake.",1
"but damn, youve had a lot to deal with in what.",1
does your mom ever tell you why she doesnt want treatment?,1
any problems at your house between your parents?,1
"uh, i think if you drive a truck or operate machinery, you have to let your boss know, and you cant do much until you find out if and how it affects you.",1
just waiting for your grandma to die.,1
"wow, op, that was really worth reading!",1
a lot of adults dont have their shit together either.,1
you just gotta start somewhere.,1
"you could apply, and if you get accepted, consider a gap year if you dont feel ready.",1
having to go through that alone is probably more than most people can handle.,1
"but you have your brother, you know?",1
you gotta stick together through this.,1
"you do realize thats what were here for, right?",1
"youre not a waste of time or waste of anything, ok?",1
we want you to know you matter.,1
"like at parks, or barber schools, or homeless shelters?",1
"i think you made the right choice, calling them.",1
"now that you have the resources available, i hope you follow through with treatment.",1
"i dont think the insulin will kill you, so might as well not try.",1
check out /r/raisedbynarcissists.,1
people have a lot of the same stories as you.,1
i remember having those thoughts.,1
pro-suicide comments including any explicit discussion of suicide methodsyour post probably get taken down by the mods.,1
"maybe it wont go away, but it might make it better.",1
have you thought of giving it a chance?,1
i wouldnt be able to tell you.,1
i think your doctor would have to examine you a bit more in depth and then hed make a choice.,1
"sorry, i got back from classes.",1
i dont think employers are allowed to know about this kind of stuff unless it involved your work place.,1
i kinda want to talk to sober you at some point.,1
"woke up a few hours ago, had breakfast, and im procrastinating instead of doing work for my computer science class.",1
"thats okay, im sick and i cant stop my runny nose or sneezing, hehe.",1
"well, if you really dont have motivation, watching a movie isnt too much to ask, right?",1
and i can assume you dont want to tell anyone.,1
"i dont want to give you advice, because thats the last thing you need.",1
your friend is lucky to have someone like you with him.,1
"having a sick friend kinda puts a strain on others, since sometimes we feel like were responsible to be with them.",1
dont be afraid to talk to someone.,1
"were here, and well be your friends, if youll let us.",1
"if she doesnt love you, theres no point hanging on to her.",1
someone who deserves you will come along.,1
"and like /u/feeling_groovy said, its nothing to be ashamed of, its not life changing.",1
"its just taking a few more minutes a day to look after yourself, like showering of combing your hair/",1
"tough life doesnt begin to describe yours, i guess.",1
i think youre looking at the stupid people.,1
"maybe it wont mean mood much, but were here.",1
when do you start seeing a therapist?,1
can i get back to you tomorrow?,1
im just really exhaustion and need some hypersomnia.,1
philosophical discussion about suicide belongs in /r/suicidology or /r/philosophy.,1
"i dont know what you believe in, but i believe that we are conscious of ourselves.",1
youre not considering it just because a chair and you are made of atoms?,1
"wait, who the hell posts videos like that?",1
being young and depressed mood is not an easy situation.,1
whats your life like?,1
will any of them matter to you is the real question.,1
whyd you turn down medication?,1
youre not letting anyone down.,1
suicidal thoughts are very real and very hard to deal with.,1
"if youre gonna tell someone, let that be a doctor.",1
"i dont know if youre still there, but i want to ask you something.",1
tell us everything about yourself.,1
"you seem to be set on going, and none of us can really stop you.",1
and what do they think of your mental depression?,1
"they want to make this world worse, thats their problem.",1
ill try my goddamn hardest to make it better.,1
i hope you follow through with it.,1
"i hope it never gets to the point where thatll happen, op.",1
"it sounds like youve been burnt before, many many times.",1

"out of interest, have you considered that it might play a part in your depression?",1
"i smoked every day for 12 years, recently stopped - and the world is very different, i do a million more things than i ever did, all of which seem to give me a sense of purpose and meaning.",1
"try checking out /r/leaves - if you dont feel that way, no harm, no foul, just my 2 cents.",1
"cocaine/alcohol/drugs will fuck with your sense of self, this isnt you - this is the chemicals in your brain, your tattoo is the kind of tattoo someone whos strong gets, be strong and pick up the phone.",1
"i dont know what they said because theyve deleted it but i just want you to know that you sound like a strong person considering all youve been through, please stay that way.",1
"go to your neighbours, tell them you feel incredibly sick and need an ambulance.",1
"thanks for sticking around, i dont know you but ive been worried about you since we stopped hearing from you.",1
"enjoy your book and when youre done or you get bored, dont dissapear inside your head again, do something else.",1
"you think youre done but things change every single day, maybe not in a way you can notice, but they do.",1
"and when things change, they will change the way you feel.",1
"there are a million things you still have to experience and i do not know you, but i believe you would enjoy experiencing them.",1
"yes, you should talk to them, anyone, about these thoughts.",1
i have no doubt in my mind that people love you and care about you and would desperately want to talk to you if they knew this is how youre feeling.,1
"when the thoughts start, go and do something else, build a model airplane, watch a movie, read a book, call someone - the solution is not in your head, its in the world and you need to be in it, experiencing it, to see that.",1
and the fact that you say  means youre not sure - this is a permanent solution to what can be a temporary problem.,1
maybe you were distractibility with something?,1
"it sounds like youve struggled to keep your life together, and for a long time.",1
"and even when you felt like giving up, you got back up and kept going.",1
thats a very nice thing to hear!,1
di honestly hope that things go more smoothly than what you have been through.,1
good luck and enjoy life as you want it to be.,1
and thanks for posting this too.,1
im sure theres someone out there who needed to hear this.,1
"dont go man, its not worth it.",1
"if you know them very well, get them to trust you a lot.",1
"once they trust you, try to persuade that professional help is the best thing they can do to get help and comfort them while persuading.",1
what did you do to  your family?,1
theyre supposed to love you no matter what.,1
did you ask them if they think you are a disappointment or do you just assume?,1
"im not joking, you literally just said what i did 30 minutes ago.",1
"i was laying down, hanging around with my friends, and playing pokemon.",1
now the easy way is actually not bad.,1
"if you can do something in less steps and still receive the same outcome, why do extra?",1
"however, we cant do that because as you know, were both struggling to pass our classes.",1
"also, im sure you know theres a balance between phobia, social life and school work.",1
"you need to socially interact with people, because connections are important in daily lives.",1
"however, school work is necessary to go to college and actually have a stable job.",1
"its more like  and like normal people, we choose the more relaxing one.",1
people too have the same struggles as you have  and all our minds look into the idea of suicide.,1
dont invalidate your feelings.,1
"the problem is not feeling this way, but how you go about fixing it.",1
"so sure the aftermath of rape, or even the sufferers of diseases are very bad, and i agree its worse than our problems right now.",1
but what we feel and our reasons are still valid.,1
"and so, its fine to talk about your feelings.",1
im actually grateful that you allowed me to listen to your thoughts because that allowed me to say what im feeling.,1
"if you want my advice, set aside your thoughts of suicide for now, and start studying and focusing for the exam more than you ever done in your life.",1
"do what you can, and try to do more than that.",1
"and if you ever have those thoughts of suicide after you see that exam, sedated state down and think or just talk to me again.",1
"i have never actually failed a class, but some people do and it just happens.",1
"this happens to some, but they somehow manage to get pass it and strive very drug abuse.",1
"again, ive never failed a class  and so i dont know how they do that.",1
but im not going to find out and you should think the same.,1
"i cant see the future, but were almost done and we should finish with 110% effort.",1
i write a lot because i just want to be clear as possible.,1
i actually dont write that much in my english class.,1
honestly im so jealous right now for two reasons lol.,1
im so fat right now and i cant do anything about it.,1
"now, you should proud of who you are.",1
"if you hang around megacolon, toxic people, theyre only going to make you sick.",1
there are a lot of different people around you.,1
ill take reddit for an example.,1
"you say that smarts but when you say , that includes reddit and look at the comments!",1
there are all sorts of people who care about your problems and are willing to help you to get through them.,1
"most do care about having fun, but thats not the only thing.",1
"if you open up a bit and try to find some people that you have similar interests to, youll see that life is not that bad.",1
"again, from what you said, i dont think you are bad person at all.",1
"if you ever need a person to talk to, im here.",1
"actually, my doctor just said that i was going through mental depression, but i dont see me being depressed mood so.",1
"maybe if you tell me about your day, maybe well see something.",1
"keep in mind, even though i may be clueless to some things, im still trying to help you.",1
"im not trying to encourage suicide or anything, but a driving  could put others people in danger as well as you.",1
"theyre innocent, so i dont think harming innocent people is a good idea.",1
"im basically like you, except im forced to work, i dont drink, and im younger than you.",1
"honestly, lying on the couch and lurking on reddit sounds really nice right now.",1
life is going way too fast and is so demanding of you.,1
"however, i cant because school and finals and all.",1
theres really no time for any of this.,1
"furthermore, i also fake all the time.",1
i always try to be the typical  while getting along with the people who like to see hitler as  and etc.,1
"but really, im more of a depressed mood, pessimistic guy.",1
"seriously, i prefer being alone and i do believe people helping me is a burden on their part.",1
"they say its fine, but theyre essentially taking their valuable time for me and i cant always give back and you just feel guilty.",1
"to simplify, im like you in some ways.",1
the constant movements in life are way too rushed and theres never time to stop and think because of our society today.,1
now please talk to a psychiatrist.,1
"it is their job to talk and help others, and im sure they will be glad to talk to you.",1
"if you just want to talk to someone, go to   basically, theres someone there to talk to you and you dont meet face to face.",1
"ive never been on that website, but i think its easier talking on the internet than face to face.",1
"im usually on every day, but it may take a while for me to reply.",1
"im on at certain hours, but i will reply quickly as soon as i see it.",1
"now, i dont see a reason to hate yourself.",1
"similarly, many people have that feeling of being worn out.",1
just sedated state down and talk to someone.,1
"if you dont have enough energy to go to a psychiatrist, then just go on that website i mentioned.",1
"now keep in mind that even though we have similar problems, i highly doubt i understand your situation as much as i think i do.",1
"so i apologize in advance for anything that may offend you, and anything insensitive is completely unintentional.",1
everyone is unique and everyone helps society in their own way.,1
"some people may give smaller help than others, but its still help.",1
stop focusing on the bad qualities and focus on the good qualities.,1
"if the bad ones are bring you down, improve them.",1
i think youre taking this too fast.,1
you sound like me right now.,1
you feel absolutely worthless and in ache.,1
"but if you ended it now, it may cause ache to others, which is no good.",1
"well, based on what you said, youre a really nice person and i probably dont understand the extent of ache youre feeling right now.",1
"sure i think i have similar problems like yours, but ill never know.",1
"to tell you the truth, i too think im not that smart.",1
"a burden, an idiot, a failure, an embarrassmentname that i constantly hear inside my mind and/or from others.",1
and i know why they call me that.,1
the stress to keep up is overwhelming.,1
"but when i lost the will to keep going, it just made things worse.",1
i took any punishments/attacks/insults that were coming to me like i deserved it.,1
"i cant die though, or else ill inflict great ache onto my youngest brother and i cant do that.",1
"so for now, ive ignored it and tried to move on.",1
theres not much i can do right now and its going to follow me till i fall again.,1
but at least i know what is causing me ache.,1
"now, you should really find out whats causing you ache.",1
"i dont really know, but i feel its not some thing, but rather its something missing.",1
"you say you have a perfect family, and good friends.",1
"until you do, nothings going to change and that sucks.",1
"for now, just place those thoughts aside for now and keep going.",1
"this is hard to hear, but you cant just make your problems disappear at this time.",1
i cant say itll get better or worse.,1
ive hoped for a better future myself and its still doesnt look too bright.,1
but ive chose to move on and see how it goes.,1
the ache is definitely still there despite how much ive tried to hide and push it back.,1
"but its no use struggling to fix it now, when so many things are going to pass by.",1
im sorry that i cant give you a straight answer on how to solve your problems.,1
but just know that theres always someone out there that feels very closely to what youre feeling right now.,1
"to clarify, just sedated state down and try to forget about it for now.",1
i know its easier said than done and you probably think im highly insensitive .,1
"but just try and understand that its not going to get better right away, but things will change.",1
"and if it gets worse, just come back here again.",1
"but at the end, were all human and we all make mistakes.",1
everyone goes through the point where they feel worthless compared to others and there are different ways to fix it.,1
we just dont have the answer in front of us right now.,1
just sedated state down and forget it for now.,1
theres really no use to thinking about it too much.,1
"even only you had more free time, your problem would have been resolved a long time ago.",1
you just need do something to keep you happy.,1
"i could give some examples, but you should try to find it yourself.",1
why do you want to kill yourself?,1
"i admit, its truly nice you care for your family and friends.",1
"ya, i would be stuck if i was in your situation.",1
i think this is more of a family situation between your sos brother and your so.,1
"however, you can support him by helping your so to stay strong.",1
"if his brother goes, whos to say that your so will also be sad because of that fact?",1
"maybe other redditors can think of another way, but this is just my opinion.",1
i think youre just stress out and dont have everything planned.,1
"youre just not a phobia, social guy and you dont have everything all sorted out.",1
im still working on lots of homework and i was also helping my mom with stuff.,1
"in your life, youre gonna have some ups and downs.",1
"whenever youre feeling down, you can talk to me.",1
please dont do anything too hasty.,1
theres more to life than just girls.,1
"sure she was special to you, but people move on.",1
"of course, most struggle with this, especially if it just happened recently.",1
"now that ive said that, i have to tell you i am not in a relationship and never had one either.",1
"so i cant completely understand your situation, but ive had friends who suffered from break-ups and its definitely not easy.",1
its very sad and i just want to make sure you dont do anything too drastic without thinking first.,1
"based on what you said, i can only assumed you loved your girl very much.",1
"however, some people just fall out of love and they want to meet new people.",1
"of course the person thats ventricular dysfunction, left behind is going to chest pain a lot.",1
its not something you can hypersomnia on or play an hour of video games to get over it.,1
"i know youre in great ache right now, all im saying is thats fine, but you too should move on.",1
dont take it too extreme and end your life.,1
"also, it could be good that you both have split.",1
"i do not know why she ventricular dysfunction, left you, but i can guess that she didnt love you like before.",1
"but if you both stayed together, she will not be happy.",1
"and remember, the person who cares the least controls the relationship.",1
"also, if shes not happy, you probably will not be so happy soon.",1
"therefore, you just have this sad relationship, and thats no good.",1
"life consists of a lot of things, some that most people dont see.",1
"right now, youre focused on your broken relationship.",1
lifes not all about girls and love.,1
i cant promise whats going to happen in your life.,1
"but remember, time will heal this and life has its ups and downs.",1
"right now, your life is clearly down to rock bottom.",1
"i cant say how your life will go next, but i can tell you that if you can move on, you could feel a bit better.",1
this only works if you choose to.,1
"if you need to talk, please talk to me.",1
"i may not be the best, but my ears are open for those who want me to listen.",1
best of luck and i hope you feel better.,1
"i cant really understand your situation because im still too young, but i do know that youre in great ache right now.",1
the reason youre in ache is because you chose to center love in the first place.,1
"i dont mean mood to sound so inconsiderate, but it is the truth.",1
i think you need to relax and find what is truly the center of your life.,1
btw what is going on between you and him?,1
"im sorry, but what you said was kinda vague.",1
there are millions of people and everyone is different.,1
so it really doesnt matter what people think.,1
you can be whatever you want to be.,1
"and again, there are millions of people, youll find someone",1
"sorry, i didnt mean mood to be insensitive.",1
"however, i just wanted to show that his problems can be fixed and is not that bad.",1
"also, i now know what i said was wrong and its ok to call me out, but at least im trying to help this person.",1
"i was looking through the comments and i didnt see you try to help him at all, but only here to say im wrong.",1
you should direct your energy into helping those in need rather than the helpers.,1
"otherwise, i assume youre just trying to offend me or something idk.",1
its all learning and stuff with my teachers.,1
"i dont understand, do you want to her to know or is that a problem?",1
and do you still need help with suicide?,1
terribly sorry for my ignorance.,1
"i feel sorry for you, but i just cant relate.",1
its just because i stop having friends for birthdays at 10 years old.,1
and people go by in school and just say happy birthday.,1
"and when its the weekend, theres 3 or 4 people on facebook saying happy birthday to me.",1
"however, i really stopped looking at my birthday as an actual birthday and make it an excuse.",1
"i just say that for my birthday, i would like a family reunion.",1
"seriously, i think thats the best birthday gift.",1
being surrounded by a big family always makes me happy.,1
"a couple of times, there were always some to forget to bring presents, but i just shrug it off and say that doesnt matter.",1
"i know you feel like youre  with people, but just try to look at the bright side.",1
you got reddit saying happy birthday and youre one step closer to 18 if youre into that.,1
turn the situation around to be in your favor.,1
"enjoy being 17 and dont be sad, because youll miss all the great things that will happen in the future!",1
"i may not be able to relate, but im with 100%.",1
"getting over lost things is terribly difficult, whether it might be a friend, family, or even losing a special pencil.",1
"but if you cant find it, you have to let it go  and move on.",1
"while you are grieving, countless things are happening everyday and you would be missing that.",1
"moving on is difficult, but everyone has to do it at one point.",1
and anything is only troublesome if you only think that way.,1
"if you can forget and move on, its more beneficial rather than grieving.",1
there is always a new beginning.,1
"when something has ended, something else has begun.",1
"but again, its up to you if you want to find out.",1
im particularly exhaustion at this time.,1
"i applaud for being a considerate human being, even to take the blame for something you didnt deserve.",1
"unlike me , you actually care more about others.",1
"again, its a nice thing, but sometimes too nice leads to bad consequences.",1
"right now, youve always cover for anyone at fault.",1
"you need to stop covering for people, and let them take whats coming to them.",1
"sure in the beginning, itll feel even more painful to watch and youll feel even more compelled to cover for them.",1
but they need to take the hit.,1
im just going to make an example.,1
say youre playing with a friend on your smartphones.,1
"but all of the sudden, your friends phone breaks.",1
"based on what you said, you take the blame for him and pay the phone.",1
"the next day, youre doing the same thing again with your friend.",1
but he somehow breaks it again.,1
"instead of panicking, hell look to you to take the blame.",1
"the truth is, your problems probably have to do with things that are actually important .",1
but what im trying to say is that people need to learn their lesson.,1
"itll chest pain at first, but theyll learn.",1
"on the other hand, if you try to take the blame, they wont learn and probably look to you to take the blame again.",1
"you may see yourself as the good guy for protecting others from blame, but youre really make yourself the bad guy and are harming others.",1
"theyll probably do the same again, and youll feel worse and worse.",1
"people need to take responsibility for their own mistakes, not you.",1
"if you continue to be a scapegoat, youll only receive more blames and feel more ache.",1
"but if you stop here and clear your name, the blames will be lifted and your mind could feel a bit better.",1
do yourself a favor and stop take the blame.,1
"if they are going to do all sorts of criminal acts like this, you may as well just go and tell the media.",1
"theyll be discovered as who they really are and possibly, the weight of your shoulders will be lifted.",1
"if you are going to tell the media, tell them what you know and also explain how they  you for telling the truth and show them proof of this .",1
"im sure theyll take this matter seriously because invading privacy is no joke, no matter who you are.",1
"theyll protect you and hopefully, this will be resolved.",1
you are doing the right thing.,1
"from your writing, i can tell youre a smart person and you just were at the wrong place at the wrong time.",1
report them and run to safety.,1
tell me the aftermath if you actually do this.,1
however please dont kill yourself over this.,1
"they are in the wrong, not you.",1
"before you do that, sedated state down and think logically.",1
"even if you dont die from overdose, that many pills will cause ache to your organs and who knows what kind of suffering lies ahead?",1
"either way, please dont do this.",1
its definitely not a good idea.,1
"now, why do you want to do this?",1
whats the point for all of this?,1
i want to do neuroscience as well!,1
dont say its out of the picture.,1
"its important to have those dreams, so you could keep going.",1
thats proof that youll be fine.,1
so dont give up until the very end.,1
"even if youre in college, theres gotta be a hobby or something you do for fun.",1
"from what you say, i feel absolutely sorry for your tragic problems.",1
"i know the feeling when youre on the right track, but then something pops up and screws up everything.",1
"and when youre already frustrated, another problem rises.",1
"overall, its bs and sucks like hell.",1
but there are some things you just have to let go.,1
you need to let her go because remembering her actions right now will only make it worse.,1
its like someone punches you and youre supposed to .,1
"but if you remember and keep that ache, itll never go away.",1
so you can either keep the ache or let it go.,1
"the cancer problem, to me, is pure coincidence.",1
i cant  completely understand your predicament right now because i dont have cancer.,1
"but you should still strive for the phd, because not many people can get there.",1
"let go of the ache, because keeping it will only chest pain you.",1
"also, continue with your studies.",1
ill try to help you step by step.,1
girls are not your entire world .,1
you should meet other people and see how that works.,1
"grades are extremely important, but dont let bad grades consume you.",1
"when i was in 9th grade, i was in danger of failing my biology honors class  and i got depressed mood that this may ruin my whole life.",1
"but i turned that around by asking my parents for tutoring, trying very hard, and asking my teacher/counselor what i could do better.",1
most people dont take mental depression seriously.,1
most guys just call that being  or .,1
but its a real thing and dont let people get to you.,1
"anyone can send info, but its up to you to take it.",1
"and if people are making fun, give no attention to it and work on turning everything around.",1
"idk what to say, because this is one of the best success stories i know right now.",1
"before i say anything, you did say that you  so im going to give a short, and honest answer.",1
im terribly sorry if im a bit insensitive.,1
"effort, intelligence, talent, and luck are the only 4 things that will get you anywhere.",1
but how you play the game is a problem.,1
theres a bunch of tips and tricks on how you get progress in life.,1
"on the other hand, hard work is needed to keep going, and intelligence and talent both help.",1
"so if you havent put in effort on what you want, you will not progress.",1
"sometimes, youre just lucky and you move on.",1
"most of the time, its all about how much effort you put in.",1
but how hard it seems is all up to you.,1
"and when you really stop caring, its only going to get harder and harder for you.",1
"not because life gets harder every day, but because you let it accumulate.",1
"then at one point, life is too hard for you to deal with.",1
and so you give up like so.,1
how you let life throw stuff at you is your decision.,1
theres a difference between staying there and taking the blows rather than doing something about it.,1
"to clarify, life is a game where whoever knows how to play it, wins.",1
"theres no level of difficulty, but how hard you make it seem is up to you.",1
"again, that was just a straight answer because i assume you wanted it like that.",1
make sure you say it carefully though.,1
"she may not look like it, but in a suicidal state, people are very sensitive.",1
"i give advice, but i cant actually do it myself just because i write online better than actually talking.",1
"its a flaw, but i get over it.",1
"dont anxiety, i know how you feel.",1
"anything bad that they do, i get pointed at first.",1
"but this happens at least twice everyday, and its not fun.",1
"honestly, its because of the fact you tried marijuana and e-cigs is whats making your parents treating you differently.",1
they just dont believe you have good judgement anymore.,1
"so even when youre telling the truth, all they hear is excuses so you can pull a fast one and go smoke.",1
they lost their trust of you and so theyre acting this way.,1
maybe actually go to those catholic therapists.,1
"im not supposed to use religion as a solution, but if you obey your parents, maybe theyll trust you again.",1
"if it will not, may as well go to stop your parents.",1
im still going to say that you should stop with the e-cig and especially marijuana.,1
"i dont know much about e-cigs, but marijuana is very harmful and dangerous.",1
"im still really young, but my dad had the same problem.",1
"after he found it, he had to go through all sorts of tests, competing with others.",1
"fortunately, he got the job and hes been doing very good for these couple of years.",1
"but during the unemployment time, my dad was extremely stress out, like you.",1
but your problem is different from my dads.,1
i honestly think you rushed into adulthood unprepared.,1
"but in this economy, its not only hard for you to look for a job, but many others as well.",1
"based of what ive learned and listened to, connections are great advantage to look for jobs.",1
"by connections, i mean mood others that you know well.",1
"without connections, finding a job is easier said than done.",1
"right now, marijuana and smoking will not help you.",1
"the feeling of motivation may feel good for now, but will only lead to drug craving.",1
immediately stop right now and get some help.,1
"and i dont mean mood help in stopping addictions, but looking for jobs.",1
"in desperate times, you need all the help you can get, and this is one of those times.",1
ask your family and your friends to keep an eye for any job openings.,1
and im sure there are websites that can help you look for jobs.,1
"honestly, its better than hiding in your room while your parents are  you.",1
"while doing that, continue looking for jobs and keep having hope.",1
"the more you run away the problems, the worse it may get.",1
"once you get exhaustion of running, itll catch up and consume you again.",1
best thing right now is to fix it quickly before that happens.,1
"well, i dont think suicide would be the answer in your case.",1
"one things for sure, you dont need to live up to others expectation of you.",1
"they get what they get, and they shouldnt get upset.",1
"remember, you cant make everyone happy.",1
live up to what you expect of yourself.,1
"they can encourage you because they believe you have potential, but they cant force their expectations onto you.",1
i think you should focus on yourself first.,1
"from what ive seen with many people on here, they like to place others before themselves.",1
but you cant help others when you have problems.,1
"so for now, set aside the problems of your boyfriend and your mom for now.",1
"i apologize for being insensitive, but you cant help others when you need help yourself.",1
"also, if you dont meet your expectations of yourself when you wanted to, then lower it a bit.",1
"this sounds kinda weird, but its the truth.",1
you dont get better overnight.,1
you work towards your goal and sometimes you set it too drug abuse.,1
"but once you meet that lower expectation, strive for higher.",1
"again, dont live up to expectations of others.",1
"your sister may be great, but that doesnt mean mood youre no good.",1
"in addition, you shouldnt anxiety how others look at you too much.",1
"if you stop comparing yourself to others, you could feel a bit better.",1
now i know youre a good person.,1
"you care about so many people, and i assume you helped your little sister when she was young.",1
the only problem you have is just comparing yourself to others.,1
"as soon as you let it go, your perspective on life could change.",1
"love will come and happiness and people come and go, but you are you and no one else can replace you.",1
i have to admit that i probably dont understand your situation as much as yourself.,1
"so if anything above is wrong, feel free to call me out.",1
"and if you need someone to talk to, ill be glad to.",1
its all the same and or even more boring than the last.,1
i assume you have feelings of confusion and thats normal.,1
"im the same, and i dont know how to fix this, but i can help you with one thing.",1
you can try biking or walking .,1
or just bike along the beach or wherever theres a nice breeze.,1
"i dont know, but thats what i did.",1
its that feeling of exploration because ive never been along the beach.,1
"even though its completely tiring, it was loads of fun.",1
just keep going and maybe something random will happen.,1
"life is full of surprises, but it doesnt happen every day.",1
"and sometimes, you find your own excitement.",1
but what really helped me was changing my life rapidly like 360 degrees!,1
i started doing sports although ive always been a loonly gamer.,1
i also made some friends and i managed to get a girlfriend whom i really love!,1
i can only tell you that you have to figure out yourself if theres something worth living!,1
in my point of view it can only get better cause if you kill yourself its already over!,1
why not see what comes next is my personal attitude since a while !,1
i know that feeling you got right now but there is always a reason to carry on!,1
suicide is never a proper solution!,1
there are so many people who really like you as you wrote yourself friends and so on whom are worth living on for!,1
even if life can be a real asshole sometimes there is always a second chance!,1
when did you stop giving yourself a second chance?,1
i belief you can find someone who loves you the way you are !,1
try to talk to friends or your parents if you feel down!,1
explain to them that you feel so loonely!,1
just carry on i beliefe in you!,1
hang in there i know that feeling!,1
i mean not everything is perfect now but what i figured out is that there is always something worth carrying on!,1
just carry on and dont be afraid of rapidly changing smth.,1
sometimes change is what you need to get on and find yourself!,1
but today i know that its no good solution!,1
if you commit suicide you give away the chance to become happy again.,1
to meet people who like you the way you are and who understand what youve been through!,1
i know it often seems as if the pain would never end but believe me im convienced better times will come you can make it if you only hold trough!,1
always remind yourself that there are still things you want to experience when your healthy again!,1
you can make keep your head up!,1
no need for thanks it just makes me happy that it maybe helped someone else.,1
i just wanted you to know you arent alone,1
"im so sorry for your pain but you are not alone in it, yes its all different to everyone but the common is that we understand.",1
i know it seems your life is hopeless and isnt going anywhere.,1
i know youre ignored and not heard but i hear you and i feel you.,1
as much as it would be freeing what happens when right before you hit it blinks in your mind stop.,1
"music helps, art helps, writing helps, just you gotta find your release and until then talk to me message me.",1
tell me how you feel and ill listen im right here.,1
i take solace in knowing that at the end of the day everything adds up to zero.,1
"meaning that for every asshole out there, there is someone whos as much of a good person as they are an asshole.",1
i know how awful it feels to be depressed.,1
"i hope that because of my own experience with similar feelings, that you will believe me when i tell you that shit isnt as bad as you think.",1
"even when it sucks, you gotta remind yourself of this.",1
"also, remember that random folks you never even met care about you, and want you to be alright.",1
"im not much of a people person, but i want you to be alright.",1
"when other people read this, theyll tell you the same thing.",1
now heres my answer to your question:,1
"just say--  or whatever feels right, but do it.",1
being active in pretty much any manner helps much more than you would think.,1
"make a small adventure-- go on a walk, and make it your mission to find some random free thing that you can put in your apartment.",1
"if you can, take a picture of it, and put it here.",1
"dont know if its weird to check up on ones secret santa or not, but i was curious about you.",1
"saw this, so i figured id comment.",1
"by 11th grade, its not unusual for people to be kind of moving in their own directions.",1
"everyone is figuring something out, whatever it may be-- that school sucks, that their town sucks, that they have the wrong friends, that they dont have friends, that theyre finally going to have to do something with themselves or get stuck, etc.",1
"its like  maybe youre there, maybe not.",1
dont increased sweating it-- the point is that this makes lot of ripples and splashes in what has been an overall predictable experience up until this point.,1
"without knowing anything else, i would first guess that theyre re-defining themselves in some way, like how you do when youre trying to end a conversation by getting near the door or turning slightly to the side.",1
"they might also just be social fear about moving on to wherever or whatever, and theyre cutting ties with folks on their own terms, before those ties are cut for them.",1
"right now, you may be used to thinking of friends in terms of  friends, but thats primarily because youve been herded together as a group through school for much of your life.",1
"but as circumstances change, the people around you do as well-- going to college, finding a job in a bigger city, traveling with a job; these all bring new people into play in your life.",1
"in time, theyll probably be more significant as well, because youll be sharing experiences with them, and not with some person you knew in drug abuse school.",1
so i dont know-- you might not have friends right now.,1
"confidence  pretty much covers all possible fuck-ups, handicaps, etc you may have in meeting/talking to people.",1
"its kind of funny, because i remember drug abuse school absolutely sucked for me, but looking back, it had the potential to be ridiculously easy if id ever had a bit of courage/confidence about the whole thing.",1
"took a long time to figure it out, so maybe the freakin book i just wrote will save you some time and trouble.",1
"good luck with it, let me know how it goes.",1
"although this person didnt believe it was possible, their life meant a great deal to many others-- parents, siblings, classmates, etc.",1
"he was convinced nobody cared for him, that nobody was there to share his troubles, or who could understand how he felt.",1
"the reality was that many people were there, and they did care, but that he just didnt see it yet.",1
"surely there are people at school you might like to know better, but do you always express this openly?",1
youre not the only one who doesnt.,1
"there are kids who think similarly to you, who understand you, who might be your friend, who can help you along.",1
growing up is a process of finding these people slowly along the way.,1
"give things time, youll come through.",1
message me if youd like to talk.,1
"as someone who is just like your friend, she needs someone to comfort her and to tell her that someone in this world loves and cares for her.",1
"she needs to come to accept she will need consoling, you cant make her go because it is for some a scary thing to go too.",1
no one wants to relive the depressed mood parts of life or be told,1
i dont know what you have gone through but im sure someone will miss you even if you dont think they will.,1
"life as meaningless and hard as it may seem, will one day be better.",1
"im sure youre mom and brother will miss you and, although i dont know you, ill miss you and the rest of this sub reddit will miss you.",1
"so please, even if you think it is a good idea, dont do it tonight.",1
"instead, talk to a friend or vent to me if you dont want to talk to a friend of yours.",1
"ill talk to you when you need someone, i promise.",1
i messaged him too but i guess hes too shy/i am not sure what to message back.,1
i greatly appreciate you going back into my posts to get to know me better.,1
"please dont give up, i can relate to what you are going through.",1
"please, if anything, find someone from your university that you trust and confine in them, that is what i did and it saved me with out getting the cops involved.",1
"i called the cops on the first person who sexually abused me  and although it saved me from being near him again, i will admit it is scary but well worth it.",1
please do something to get you out of that situation before you harm yourself.,1
"pm me if you want and i will give you my email, facebook what ever you need and i will talk to you whenever you feel hopeless.",1
i promise things do get better.,1
"pm me and tomorrow night if you want to talk more or have a pen pal though christmas, i can give you my email.",1
but one thing i ask is that you dont do it.,1
someone will always care even if they dont seem like they do.,1
"hey, i know shit seems hard and that people are the biggest assholes but after reading your post in r/confessions, i think you are a strong woman with her priorities strait.",1
sure it may not be a job most people would consider but you are just trying to survive.,1
i think you can do it and have your child grow up to be everything you want her to be.,1
please pm me if you want to talk.,1
"ive always wanted overlord with the raising hell expansion, and overlord 2.",1
a virus named tom looks great too if youre willing to give those up :,1
thank you for your generosity!,1
i had to find the right places and the right major for some of my anxiety mental depression to go away.,1
"i know its not much but if you ever need someone to talk too, im generally always online.",1
"hey, im sorry for all of the trolls and the assholes.",1
ive seen them on many occasions and i have been at the brunt of their harassment.,1
but i am sure there are many people who care about you and want to help you.,1
if i was on reddit during the time of this incident i would have done all i could to tell the trolls to fuck off and would have defended you.,1
"if you are still on, i would like to talk with you.",1
they really dont give a fuck but dont want to be held responsible later so if theres a risk of suicide they get involved.,1
after the threat is over they typically move away emotionally and place a lot of distance between you and themselves.,1
if they genuinely cared they would know that distance does little to help.,1
then again if they really cared it may not have gotten to the point of suicide in the first place.,1
now im 24 and i couldnt be happier with life.,1
"make daily goals for yourself, and also set some more long term goals.",1
"the daily goals will help you get through the tough days, and the more long term goals will give you something to look forward to.",1
im very glad you mentioned you feel optimistic about your recovery.,1
life has a great many things to offer.,1
i for one and glad you are still here :,1
"the reason i ask is because generally teenagers are dickheads to the nicest people, so i have a suspicion that is the problem.",1
"trust me, in a couple of years life will be much better.",1
"you arent a sociopath, and there is nothing wrong with you.",1
people just have a habit of being asshats to those who least deserve it.,1
"ah, apparently im pretty ignorant on the subject and for that i apologize.",1
the way you handled that just further cemented my respect for you.,1
and i love every day of my life now.,1
"it releases endorphins so you will feel happy and accomplished, and you will start becoming a better and healthier you.",1
"at 15 my biggest worries were girls and my next test, and neither of those really mattered in the long run.",1
"its important to have fun, but dont stress about making everything perfect.",1
"we didnt get along when i was a teenager, but if i had died it would have destroyed them.",1
they would have no purpose to living.,1
"it may not seem like it right now, but i would be willing to bet that your parents care about you very much.",1
"if things have been going rough lately, just have a sit down chat with them and tell them whats on your mind.",1
and act like an adult.,1
"nothing too intense, just rather simple goals that would make you really happy to accomplish but that you wont stress about.",1
"and if things get rough, drop me a message.",1
"i dick with people a lot on here, but i dont mind talking to people having a rough time.",1
"just let her know that you care about her as a person, which im sure you already do.",1
"maybe try planning activities for yall to do, things that will help her see that there are great things in this world.",1
give her things to look forward to.,1
it takes a special kind of person to be such a dedicated friend.,1
please dont do that to your wife.,1
"if she really does love you, it would destroy her if you kill yourself.",1
"she would feel like she failed you, and maybe take her own life as well.",1
you mentioned that you are diabetic and .,1
why not stick around and do everything you can to make those who care about you as happy as you can?,1
is there a specific tv show or movie you enjoyed as a child?,1
whenever i was younger and would feel down i would watch something that i loved as a kid and it usually comforted me.,1
"youre right that i dont know you, but i do care.",1
"obviously it never worked, and im so glad it didnt.",1
didnt think i would ever find the girl for me and i didnt think i would ever amount to anything.,1
"i know it doesnt help you now, but things do get better.",1
maybe make lists of goals for yourself.,1
"a daily goal, and then more long term goals.",1
"and ive been suggesting church a lot to people on here, which im sure annoys the hell out of people.",1
you might make some new friends that way.,1
maybe even the girl of your dreams.,1
"keep your head up, and accomplish the goals you set for yourself.",1
do you have a good relationship with her?,1
"if you do, spend time with her.",1
she loves you more than anything on this earth.,1
"if you dont, try and work on yalls relationship.",1
go to the movies together sometime.,1
"i she travels for work, maybe see if you can travel with her some.",1
there is so much that life has to offer.,1
"as someone else mentioned, maybe you can get involved in some sort of charity.",1
"and if you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to message me and i will do whatever i can to help.",1
you arent being a whiny bitch.,1
you are going through a hard time in life and have every right to want to talk about it.,1
i know it isnt as wonderful as having people you can go out and actually do things with but we will do whatever we can to get you through this.,1
"breakups hurt, especially when that person doesnt seem to care about you at all.",1
"but as someone else said, the ache does go away.",1
"it hurts, and you may have to physically hold yourself together at night but just know that it gets better.",1
"if you arent opposed to church, give it a try.",1
many churches have people who genuinely care about others and maybe you can find some new friends that way.,1
"if you have a good relationship with your parents, then please talk to them about it.",1
"you dont have to tell them you are thinking about ending it, but tell them you are depressed mood very badly.",1
im sure they will do anything in their control to see their child happy.,1
oh i wasnt mentioning church in the hope that you would find jesus.,1
im not atheist but im not really religious either.,1
i just thought it might help being around other people.,1
i can promise you that humanity is not all like that.,1
it makes me sick that people you count on would be so hateful.,1
"and there is nothing wrong with taking anxiety mental depression medicine, especially with all the stress im sure you deal with on a daily basis.",1
"you will get through this, you will beat cancers ass, and be my personal fucking hero.",1
together we are going to get you through this.,1
because that helped me tremendously.,1
"anytime i was anger i would go to the gym and beat the shit out of the punching bag, run myself to exhaustion, and lift weights until i couldnt lift anymore.",1
"it will release happy chemicals, you will hypersomnia better, you will feel better, and get in better shape.",1
i would really recommend giving it a try.,1
the best thing to do is just take life one day at a time.,1
wake up every morning and ask yourself what you want to do.,1
"they dont have to be anything major, they can be something small and silly.",1
as long as it is something that will bring you happiness then it matters.,1
"once you move, try and find something that will let you spend time with others.",1
"there are usually groups that get together and hang out, and you could get to meet new people and also get free food while you are at it.",1
"be selfish, go with the hope of meeting someone who you can develop a friendship with and maybe let you drug withdrawal syndrome with them for awhile.",1
i want you to be happy and live a long and full life.,1
"im not the most qualified person in this sub, but anytime you want to talk feel free to message me.",1
the rest of the ideas might help though.,1
ive been in your situation before.,1
"alone, jobless, didnt think i would amount to anything.",1
"its rough, and life can be cruel.",1
you said you feel bad for staying with your boyfriend.,1
im sure he loves every second he spends with you.,1
"i know you are struggling with things, but just keep in mind that he definitely cares about you.",1
its all about finding your calling.,1
you could always spend your bad nights on this sub talking to others and giving them encouragement.,1
i tried to kill my self once and failed badly cause in the moment i wanted to do it i realized that i want to live!,0
i still have suicidal thoughts and i often question myself why i even carry on!,0
to come to a point this might be no reasons for you to live on.,0
i have been in hospital for like 5 months in the past year!,0
in addition to that i was struggeling hard in school due to my ilnesses!,0
furthermore i did attempt to kill myself like 4 years ago.,0
i know exactly how it feels to be under constant pain.,0
ive experienced intense pain which kept me from even getting out of my bed for more than a year.,0
i had to take extremly strong painkillers for a long period of time which lead to a easily recognizable twist in my character.,0
i was frequently aggressive aswell as feeling drowsy and anxiety most of the time.,0
in addition to that i felt so much hatred for the rest of the world because i felt it was so unguilty that i had to suffer such pain while other people whom were also my age  where at good health.,0
ive also thought of commiting suicde frequently because my childhood wasnt that nice either.,0
i was buillied frequently and my mother suffered from breast cancer.,0
all in all it was a really hard time.,0
i had no friends and with 15 i tried to commit suicde.,0
im twenty three years old and my body  is that of a sixty year olds within due to an accident i was in.,0
i was hit by a truck when i was eleven and ive been battling depression since.,0
my nana the one and only person in my world that understood died oct 1st 2002 and i was hit on apr 15th 2003 when my birthday was on may 28th.,0
it sucked massively and since that age i was homeschooled but i had to teach myself.,0
"my mom had taken to hitting me a lot and really breaking me down physically, emotionally, and everything the year my nana got illness and we were taking care of her and that was when i was 9.",0
my bio father has been in and out of my life and ive been illness since i was two years old.,0
my dad didnt want me cause i was a illness kid and have done nothing but get worse.,0
ive been raped and many other things i cant go to college due to seizures and i cant do what my heart desires.,0
"ive downed a bottle of pills before, i used to cut, used to choke myself but never could finish it no matter how bad i wanted to no matter how badly i needed to because at the end right before blanking out my brain would scream stop.",0
thank you so much for the advice.,0
the only real problem i guess i have now is that i told my dad that my suicidal thoughts and tendencies had gone away and now i need to have my parents get me to a therapist.,0
dont want to seem like a liar again.,0
ive been suicidal since i was in second grade because it  runs in my family.,0
i started really thinking deeply about it in fourth grade but nothing ever happened.,0
last year was easily my worst year and my best year all wrapped up in a big ball of deadly emotions.,0
it was my best year because i finally got the courage to tell my parents that i was suicidal.,0
it was my worst year because i tried to kill myself three times that same year.,0
after talking to my parents i felt this wave of happiness and clarity that made me feel like i really did belong here.,0
recently i feel like an empty shell of my former self.,0
"i feel like no matter how hard i try to stay happy, the world keeps shooting me back down to reality.",0
just recently i moved from a school where i knew almost everyone and could have easily made friends with anyone i wanted.,0
"everyone in my grade respected me, anybody else looking at my life from the outside would think that my life was great.",0
"that i had no pain, no suffering constantly going through my head, but they were wrong.",0
i cried myself to sleep almost everyday last year and decided that i couldnt go on living this way anymore.,0
i wanted to move in with my dad and start school over there.,0
i felt like a fresh start was something that would clear up my entire life and allow me to live stress free.,0
"i was wrong, nobody knows me for who i really am.",0
im living a fake life in a fake shell of who i really am and it sucks.,0
"i cant move back because then my grades would drop again, but if i stay here any longer i feel like everyday im getting closer and closer to my fourth attempt at suicide.",0
"i could go on for a while about the reasons i want to end my life because theyve been building up since i was in fourth grade, however im 15 and have school tomorrow so i cant tell my full story just yet.",0
"anyways, theres an extremely rough outline of my story up until now.",0
i did have a therapist for a couple of year but it didnt really seem to help the problem.,0
"i guess one of my problems is that, in my journey of a thousand miles, every time i take a step forward i seem to take two steps back.",0
i really just want to know how be happy again.,0
apparently pills just cause stomach muscle cramp and common cold chills.,0
"i dont know, i feel like im doing everything right and then the world punishes me for trying.",0
"as someone who thinks about suicide on a daily basis, a really helpful personal philosophy for me is that were all going to die eventually so why bother rushing it?",0
i switched schools as a form of suicide/rebirth.,0
"i wanted to start a new life as a new me, but now im stuck in an even worse spot than i was in before.",0
knowing me id spend all the money on lithium.,0
i need more lithium in me than the energizer bunny could ever dream about.,0
"sorry if this is unrelated, but may i ask how you got over your depression?",0
i feel like ive tried everything.,0
anything that people will remember me for after im gone.,0
"ive done some things in my life that younger me never thought i would have accomplished, but none of it keeps the memory of me alive for very long.",0
im a musical prodigy  but that doesnt really get me anywhere i want to be.,0
i cant make a career out of that to allow the memory of me to continue on.,0
to update you guys friend called police in me got send to hospital.,0
im home now some one want to talk?,0
had a relationship that went south after she moved to england,0
they use it as a threat to keep you alive.,0
im im the same boat as you with my girlfriend i tell her and they threaten to call the police.,0
also attempt suicide last thursday,0
i want someone to talk to too :,0
im trying to hold on dude tomorrow might be it,0
i tried before it didnt scare me away.,0
i reattempted and again after that.,0
but thanks for trying to help.,0
no just get home a sleep in the bathroom because i cant stand my family.,0
and no with her i cant stand anyone l.,0
i shut the lights and lay there to pretend im dead its a lot simpler to just do it :,0
dont give me that its just the constant let down of people around me to the point where im done.,0
i failed the first time in killing myself i wont fail again.,0
i have stuff i like doing and its fun and all but underneath im dying inside so its not enjoyable and the meds arent working im hopeless.,0
a great inspiration and a schizophrenic.,0
all of his songs relate to it and sadly killed himself on 12/23/2012 which adds to 2047.,0
"but that isnt how the system works, as much as you would like to believe that people who need help get help.",0
"in reality unless they can see it 100% you arent getting shit, especially with schizophrenia.",0
tried to end it last thursday im always free to talk.,0
came back home about 2 hours ago.,0
"i cant do that, i cant live a hurtful life.",0
"waited 22 years, given a chance for people to be fair with me.",0
"luckily i dont owe anything to this world or the people here, i can leave in piece.",0
i just want to die somewere where nobody will find my body.,0
i dont think anyone has earned the right to mourn me.,0
"i still love that girl, and will do anything for her.",0
but she has decided to take me off her life.,0
"more precisely, she has decided to net be there when im suffering and be there with me only when she needs me.",0
"i cant stop crying, i just want to die.",0
im just an insignificant toy for people to use and throw away.,0
"himalayas, oceans, villages, hills.",0
it just doesnt matter or make any difference.,0
thats why i have to move far away to die.,0
im really tired of sharing my story with so many people on the internet.,0
i hope youll be the last person and ill put myself out of this misery.,0
"when i was a kid, just like any other kid, i was immensely attached to my parents.",0
"when i was very very young, my parents started having problems in their relationship.",0
"but things went bad, she couldnt get the job she was hoping for.",0
she told me she is going to leave me at my dads house and find a job and come and pick me up in 2 months.,0
"when she left me at his door and i went in, it hit me.",0
i was scared to even use the washroom when i needed and urinated myself.,0
"it was pain, but not something i couldnt handle.",0
being ditched by the person i loved the most was extremely pain.,0
i dont even remember a lot of details.,0
"after 2+ years i got out of that hell, i started living with my mom and my dad provided all the financial needs.",0
he used to show all his frustration from work and outside world with my mom.,0
"i never had any friends at school, from 5th class to 8th class i was very badly bullied.",0
after that i slowly started recovering.,0
i became this model guy to everyone around me.,0
"wise, intelligent, ambitious, all that shit.",0
"but i was alone, broken in the inside, just waiting to explode.",0
and last year i met this girl.,0
"not somebody i would consider good looking, but i fell in love with her.",0
i thought finally my life is about to see some happiness.,0
"i loved her immensely, she didnt.",0
"she gets angry at me, destroys me, breaks me and once in a while, very rarely she gives me some love.",0
"she keeps me far away from her, im the least of her priorities, she has a boyfriend whom shes gonna leave with.",0
"now probably youll just give me advice to leave her and find the love that i deserve, thats what she also tell me.",0
the thing is im tired of this world.,0
"male, the person i loved doesnt even care how her words and actions pain me.",0
feel like a coward for only thinking about it.,0
"this generally lasts for almost a month, where i make up my mind well enough to attempt suicide, plan everything meticulously and take the plunge.",0
i just want to die peacefully.,0
thats why i have been alive this long.,0
there were times when i was just about to kill myself and stopped.,0
"you know what, my mom doesnt have anyone in this world who loves her, not even me.",0
im incapable of showing my love to her.,0
she is suffering a very painful life for me.,0
"if im gone shell either leave all this and live life the way she initially wanted, or shell also quit.",0
i wanted to die in a way such that my death wont be much of a mess for anyone.,0
i asked her to stay away from all her insensitive family members and lead a peaceful life.,0
"if she has to, just tell them that i died in an accident or something.",0
kept a note in my pocket saying that im an orphan and my body organs can be used wherever they are useful.,0
i dont know how long i was there.,0
"i could feel myself being dragged by one current into the ocean, while a current of water passed by towards the beach from above.",0
could open my eyes during the whole episode.,0
after a period of time i could feel the land just a oedema of extremity below me.,0
"i was in shock, im still in shock.",0
im unable to process anything.,0
"during the episode, i was happy, that i was leaving all this shit behind.",0
"after i got washed up ashore i was lying there for sometime, two guys were close to me, i dont know where they came from, they were talking about me but didnt talk to me, some people passed by, i searched for my phone, couldnt find it.",0
"i lost my spectacles somewhere, my eyesight is around -5, found it very difficult to make my way to the bus stand, im still very much wanting to leave all this shit behind, but im a coward, im not able to bear that much pain.",0
i think shooting myself in the head is the best way to go.,0
"if i had a little bit of courage, i would have went back in.",0
maybe my post history will give an idea.,0
she knows how much i love her.,0
im writing her a letter about it.,0
may be looking at my post history would help.,0
seems fun for someone who would be into it but ive never cared for traveling id much rather be home in my own bed :,0
cant explain this so i will just post and hopefully you can explain it to me,0
it doesnt stop me from trying its not fair to put them through painbut its not fair to make me stay and prolong the painjust to get the same outcome in the end.,0
thats why if it were possible to just disappear from existence and take all memories of me with me it would be done.,0
thank you for sharing i always love reading although it very rarely helps me.,0
yeah it gives color to the world when all i can see is grey,0
"as of 4/20 im no longer smoking weed so idk how this is gonna turn out i read each and every comment throughout the day, thanks for everything.",0
we both just stand there we know what it meansare we both just too tired to fight?,0
"i mustered up every ounce of strength i had today and it was all for nothing just to fail, for the last time.",0
dk just kinda wanted to put my feelings down somewhere not sure if im leaving a note yet or not probably wont,0
"even when we are in a  it is simply an ok day but we still wish to die, we wait for the black reaper to come and invite it in without hesitation.",0
300mg of efexor-xr currently one thing i do have to say is when my senses go into overdrive it is pretty entertaining being able to hear a nat from rooms away over all the other noise around me.,0
"yeah my family knows, my mom and sister are very concerned, i am very loved but i cant handle this.",0
honestly i prefer to be alone i just like to smoke and game nothing else i enjoy more,0
sorry this is so jumbled up after each  i stopped for a bit and what came after is just how it continued messy but it seems right i could edit it again and fix it but i think its perfect confusion within the thoughts like it truly is with me.,0
maybe i should try and turn this into my reason for living to use my words to tell my story and maybe affect someone else.,0
only reason im still here is because i dont have access to a gun if i did or could get one easily i would be gone.,0
so i suppose im just waiting until i can,0
been on prozac paxil but currently on efexor-xr 150mg im at a good point not depression not stuck in the tunnel theres other options this is just the one that i deem best for me considering everything.,0
"even in a tunnel of despair suicide is pretty fucking difficult to get yourself to do its a war between our minds and our instincts, but my instincts have been wrong before panic attacks over talking to people?",0
"thats suppose to happen when i see a bear in the woods and am about to get mauled thats when the adrenaline should kick in, not when i see a pretty girl and have to run and avoid her.",0
both but prefer to smoke by myself ive always kinda been a loner and just love it that way,0
"yes like i said i reactivated my facebook she wasnt the first person i posted this to, after the very first post or chapter whatever you may call it i decided to send it to her since she was the person who said to me a long time ago how good i am with words.",0
i try to ignore it when the thought starts that i know is going to cause pain lately ive just started screaming to stop when it starts but it doesnt stop i just want to not exist anymore.,0
"everyone is telling me to pretty much walk this off you have to motivate myself, no one has a fucking clue how hard ive tried gym anything finding any reason to live but i just lose interest and do like ive done with everything else in my life and give up.",0
id be dead already if i didnt have to try i cant even pull a trigger and have it end in a split second be done with all this fucked up shit.,0
im not going to live like this it either stops or i stop it,0
"probably addiction now, use to smoke because it would get me out of the tunnel open my mind up make music effect me more.",0
it stopped doing that for a while so when it came back recently its probably the only reason i havent tried again even after attempting quite a few times lately.,0
im thinking just being able to stay stoned for a while and experiencing that feeling i love so much nonstop for my final days would be nice ending it on a good note,0
im currently on 150mg effexor been on a few meds been to therapy its not helping im still so lost im surrounded by friends but im so alone and pain so bad i cant bare it anymore,0
"not going to lie its pretty scary putting the gun together hearing all the sounds it makes i put it up to my mouth to get a feel for it and imagined pulling the trigger bang and its all over, thinking about 2 to 3 hours",0
"i just keep going for those once in a blue moon days where everything is good, some days had to abuse some pills some days had to smoke until i couldnt remember shit it is what it is hopefully you can find those days brother either way i wish the best for you.",0
"no matter what i share or what people tell me, my life will be the same.",0
all the teachers fucking avoided me because i was socially awkward and didnt know hope to act.,0
i wish i fucking had that rather than abuse i got.,0
even if i graduate from something.,0
study something i will never have the life i want.,0
"some of us want to be doctors,engineers,teachers,athletes.",0
just because i want to be rich doesnt mean im selfish.,0
we all want to help everyone in the world.,0
"we just focus on helping one person, even if that person is ourself.",0
"everyone i trusted, doctors, ex girlfriend, mum.",0
couldnt help me so whats the point.,0
even though i respect your time to say something and want to help me.,0
its time for me to check out early.,0
ive just arrived at the place im going to spend my last day.,0
just like my life has always been.,0
earlier than i expected but i there is no point living through this shit anymore.,0
"i dont expect ever to be found or remembered, even before i go i may turn back and released that im a fucking idiot.",0
thank you for your help even it was for a day.,0
"it was a thing i did every day for at least 10 years, i generally loved it more than anything.",0
but whats the point in doing it if i cant make a living out of it.,0
"one day if i chose to live i may end up in a nice apartment, maybe a partner who actually understands me and doesnt call me childish or shout at me when im acting inappropriately in public.",0
"im in a circle which is i cant be with people if i dont know how to act socially, and i cant learn how to act socially if i cant be with people.",0
its a circle ive been in for years.,0
i may end up having a friend and a career but it will just mask what i want in life.,0
the only thing that has helped me was a superman comic.,0
but now the affect of that has gone.,0
if i was good at one fucking thing then i may stay around and have hope that one day i can reach my goal but no.,0
no skills in fucking anything to help me.,0
"everyone can make friends, do well at things, have a nice life but it has always been fucking me.",0
"im sorry for all the other adhd, autistic, aspergers suffers, hope you all do well in life but you have lost a team member.",0
thanks for your help and i appreciated it.,0
even if it was for a day that someone i believed cared for me.,0
"as for unemployment support, as odd as it may seem, i really dont want that.",0
"i want to know that my money is given to me because i did something, not simply because im down on my luck.",0
"as i said, ive been homeless, and i cant tell you how much it breaks my heart to see someone thats obviously struggling give me money for a meal.",0
"not that i dont appreciate it, but i feel that it isnt right taking money from another soul who needs it.",0
"nowadays i spend my nights in drunken sadness, as my  seem to think booze solves all of lifes problems.",0
"and honestly, id rather die than fall back into that path.",0
its a dark and morbid reality to live in.,0
"i guess what im trying to say is that i want to live life earning my living from those who can afford to pay someone to do honest work, rather than taking it for no work from someone who needs it.",0
"and seeing as that doesnt seem to be reality, i dont see much reason left to live in such a world.",0
my ex pulled the same shit on me.,0
"i had a gun to my head, said i wanted to die, and all she could say before she left was  i didnt stop for myself, im still crazy depressed.",0
"they say happiness is the best revenge, and thats sure as hell what im working for.",0
i really wish i could have a positive outlook like most people seem to.,0
"as a follow up to this, where do i direct my ?",0
"if im homeless, nobody will employ me.",0
ill be left with nothing but debt and a cardboard box.,0
people that wanted to help him and others like him.,0
"there were few, but they were there.",0
"now with my situation, you know who wants to help me?",0
you know who wants to help a soon-to-be homeless man with debt out the ass?,0
"not to say that your post wasnt uplifting, but he had people behind his cause.",0
ive struggled with alcoholism with nobody even offering to help.,0
"i pleaded for people to help me stop, and nobody did.",0
"not friends, not family, not counselors.",0
"and at that time, i still had some control over my life, so i was able to say  to that.",0
now ive lost that control and im still without the things i need.,0
"all i need is a job that will let me work my ass off for food on the table, but because of who i appear to be to complete strangers, its assumed that i dont need it.",0
"they all want to give the job to the older guy, who has a family backing him up, or the war vet who still has income trickling in if they really need it.",0
not the young guy looking to support himself.,0
"ive killed my habits that seeked to kill me, and ive done my best to better myself, and its landed me up shit creek without even a boat, let alone a paddle.",0
but im really fucking tired of hearing  or  .,0
im looking for a legitimate reason to not just say .,0
i just want to thank you all for the support.,0
if i dont message you then know that i am grateful for the thought and the reply.,0
it is incredibly frustrating that i am going to have to kill myself in a potentially pain way if i do not want to do something illegal in the meantime to obtain the proper substances .,0
"ive been dealing with it for long enough and it has not changed, why dont i have the option to check out easily?",0
i would be willing to take tests or do whatever in order to prove my  / rational state of mind.,0
"as in, i am not overly concerned whether i live or die and death often seems the much superior option.",0
i am not saying that i couldnt or wouldnt commit suicide.,0
"however, were life to change suddenly and become much more difficult.",0
i am in a relatively stable environment and secure in food/shelter.,0
"were those circumstances to change, i just dont know man.",0
"really, i am mainly alive through apathy.",0
"i could live, i could die, but there is risk in trying death and my basic needs are currently met.",0
"so yes, i am certainly suicidal but it is only a symptom of a larger thing.",0
okay i threw up a little bit but now i feel weird and bloated.,0
its not so much that i want to die but im scared and i dont see a way out.,0
i feel like my life is hopeless so why prolong the suffering.,0
thanks for the group i will look into it.,0
"the person that moved away i just cant talk to anymore, there was a falling out.",0
i guess i am just being unreasonable with what i want.,0
i know i need to tell my therapist how bad i am doing but dont want to end up in the hospital again.,0
"i wish i could get a second dog, but i cant.",0
he has helped me through so much.,0
"i would say the only reason i am here is because of him, i tried to hang myself and he came down to the basement and saw me hanging there and i just couldnt bear the thought of him watching me die and i was able to get on something to stop from passing out.",0
i just dont know what i will do when the time comes that he isnt there.,0
i also just dont know what to do with these thoughts anymore.,0
it seems everywhere i look i get the same response for ocd.,0
i just wish i had someone i trusted and understood what i was going through to be near me so i could just be hugged when i am at my worst.,0
i just enjoy watching it really.,0
my experience with therapy has been mixed.,0
"i am being treated for ocd, major depressive disorder, and borderline personality disorder.",0
"i have been in therapy a little over a year, stopped about a few weeks ago, but have decided to go back to it because i am going through an extremely rough time now.",0
"my search to find a therapist took about 4 months, and i really cant say i am feeling any better despite being in therapy for close to a year and seeing her every week.",0
the first session is kind of awkward as you are basically telling a complete stranger how you got to this point.,0
"ya, like i just cant bring myself to go to one.",0
"again, how can one get better when the place they should be makes the symptoms so much worse.",0
"ya, she knows that i am off my medications.",0
she also knows about my other drug use.,0
"i will be telling her pretty much everything, but again i just dont want to run the risk of being committed against my will.",0
"the issue with my parents is not a fear of being letdown or nothing happening, it is just that i dont care enough to involve them.",0
"my parents just this morning asked how i was doing, and i just told them everything was fine.",0
"they asked if i was seeing my therapist still, and said i was seeing her monday.",0
they asked if i was taking my meds and told them i wasnt.,0
"like, i cant even tell my therapist that i have a plan or anything else i get sent to the psych ward.",0
"i tell her that it doesnt help me, but she has to do it by law.",0
they just dont understand that the hospital is not a place i want to be regardless of being suicidal.,0
"unfortunately, where i live there is only 1 hospital that handles psych patients.",0
"i would, if i decided to, have to drive 3 hours to get to the next hospital.",0
i have only been in therapy really for like a year.,0
"the thoughts prevent me from doing a lot of stuff, they leave me in their control.",0
"everyday, i wake up and the thoughts are there dictating what i do.",0
it takes me an hour to shower because i need to feel right before i get out or i end up have anxiety attacks.,0
i have obsessive thoughts of harming myself and follow through with them so they stop.,0
"i just want them to stop, and all anyone can tell me is that they will not stop but that i can one day cope with them.",0
how the fuck do you cope with intrusive thoughts and violent images of hurting yourself or wanting to kill yourself.,0
the only surgeon my psychiatrist was able to find is in boston so i am not able to really talk about it.,0
again it has to do with being in a hospital.,0
even if they were not as active it would still be too much for me :,0
my family thinks i am fine because i just dont interact with them.,0
i am able to hide how i truly am from my psych and therapist so hiding from my family who i dont interact with or even really talk to is easy.,0
but nothing interests me anymore.,0
it really depends sometimes the pot will help other times it will make things worse.,0
"but i dont even have the money for a taxi anyway, or even enough to drive.",0
"i understand that my friends dont have the the ability to understand or really how to act around me, because they have found out i cut, among other things.",0
"i dont think it is really a major issue, i was let down by my friends oh well.",0
"but the thought of being around other people, whether it is a support group or a hospital just creates anxiety.",0
so i try to avoid all situations that cause anxiety.,0
"hell, i took a year off school because i was continually having anxiety issues being in class.",0
i have tried making friends with people that i have met at the hospital but maybe i am unlucky and i just end up being in the psych ward when no one even close to my age is there.,0
"the time i did meet some people one moved away, and i just dont like being around the other people.",0
"i feel so illness with myself being the way i am, that as i sit here in my room i just look in a mirror and see emptiness.",0
"my dog loves me i know that, but i cant keep going in this world with just that.",0
"what happens when he dies in a few years, the average lifespan of a cockerspaniel is like 12 years or so and he is almost 11.",0
"i know my parents would take care of him if i died, it isnt like he is actually mine.",0
"sure i spend the most time with him, and stuff but it was my parents that actually got him and raised him.",0
i didnt start bonding with him until he was 3-4 years old.,0
basically around the time my life started becoming fucked.,0
here is someone that wants help but his own illness prevents it from happening.,0
i guess that would be normal though.,0
"i wish i could believe the violent intrusive thoughts would stop, but the nature of ocd wont allow that.",0
"i just cant live with myself knowing these thoughts are there, it is just so crippling to deal with them.",0
"i want to get better, i do, but a larger part of me just wants to take the easy way out and just end my life.",0
i cant even enjoy what i used to love anymore.,0
"i cant go out in public, or even feel comfortable around anyone anymore because of the scars and current cuts.",0
i havent felt any emotion or pleasure in so many years.,0
i am not sure i am even human anymore or if i ever was.,0
it is just an empty person with no emotion.,0
"i let myself get this bad, by fucking up my attempts.",0
hospitals make things worse for me.,0
i have gone in 4 times and have come out worse then when i went in.,0
"my psych and therapist had to have the police bring me in the last time, and i will not be going back to one.",0
"i cant get better in one, when i am constantly having anxiety and stress issues when in one.",0
"but again, i will not go to a hospital.",0
"i do not get better in one, i end up getting worse because i have anxiety issues with being around that many people.",0
i end up stressing out because i am in the hospital and have a fear of them.,0
it just doesnt help me when i am in a hospital.,0
"the shitty thing is, is that i live in a small town so no private institutions at least none that are a reasonable distance.",0
"as for support groups, i really dont feel that they would help as i dont like telling anyone about what i am going through, at least in person.",0
"i also just cant be around that many people, as i go into an anxiety overdrive and just feel horrible.",0
"i have no problem travelling, i have just recently got back from montreal and put up a facade of having fun.",0
"i also just cant get up an leave either since i am in a good paying job, and going to school.",0
"this idea of time, is just something that makes me more depression.",0
why should i wait this through when i can just end it all tonight?,0
"this depression has been crippling me for several years, and ocd will not go away it will stay there.",0
i just seem like i am fooling myself by telling myself that things will get better when they havent.,0
"i have no hope left, i see everyone saying try this, try that with no success.",0
it just brings you down when shit works for other people and then it doesnt work for you.,0
"i wake up, and every second is thought about killing myself, or filled with obsessive thoughts.",0
"it just fucking sucks, and the illness has taken a toll.",0
"my arm is covered in scars, my interal organs have probably been fucked from the amount of ods that i been through.",0
i have been basically bullied since grade 1.,0
started noticing my ocd happening around grade 9 maybe.,0
i dont see it worth it at all.,0
i have trouble seeing anything be worth it at this point.,0
i really just want to end the pain that i am in.,0
"3 hours isnt too much of a drive, but i just couldnt bring myself to do it.",0
"i have too many issues driving, with thoughts of killing myself or thoughts that i may have hit something it just causes anxiety.",0
the only time i really drive is to go to work.,0
i also dont trust anyone to drive me or want to tell anyone.,0
"i am not sure if my therapist is helping or not, i have been in therapy for close to a year and have seen no results so maybe she isnt helping.",0
i cant even begin to explain the intrusive thoughts as they cause so much anxiety just thinking about them.,0
"but it is just like the thought is stuck and wont leave, always there saying the same thing over and over and over.",0
"as i have said, i just dont see myself ever being able to cope with the thoughts that cause the most distress.",0
and that is what causes the worst of my depression and causes me to cut and want to kill myself.,0
"today, i have spent the entire day in my room just crying that i am still alive and wanting to die just wanting to take more pills to end it and fighting a losing battle to not take them.",0
i dont see it ever getting better at this point.,0
i have been hoping for so long for shit to get better that at this point i have no hope left.,0
i have no will left to live left.,0
"i have been looking for new therapists, but with this town so small it just seems impossible.",0
"i am quite positive i was on everyones waiting list for about 4 months, got the one i have now and was taken off the waiting lists for other therapists so i would have to start over.",0
i know i am self sabotaging my therapy by not telling her everything but i am just to feeling nervous and lack of trust to tell her everything because i dont want to get sent to a psych ward.,0
"my parents know about my illness but right now they think i am fine and dont know how i think they would react, probably send me to the hospital.",0
they have threatened to have the police pick me up and take me to the psych ward before when they found out i was cutting again.,0
"i just dont enjoy talking or being around them it doesnt bother me that if i kill myself they would be pain, but i know that if i did kill myself they wouldnt notice for a few days.",0
"ya, as i said in my original post i stopped them in like september.",0
"as for how suicidal i am, i dont want to answer to that.",0
"for drugs i go through ganja/hash daily, and use coke/e/shrooms/opis every once and a while.",0
"naturally, i feel fine when under the influence but afterwords it is back to the hell and it just makes it more depressing but it allows an escape from it so i dont mind.",0
"it isnt that i dont want the help that is available, it is that i have just tried so much that i dont want to send myself over the edge by putting hope into something than seeing it fail.",0
again with support groups i would try them if i wouldnt be having anxiety issues around the people.,0
as for going to an institution i am still just terrified of them.,0
"i mean no one wants to go to one, i realize that.",0
"i know i must appear stubborn, because there are options out there but i dont want to use them.",0
i have emailed my therapist asking for an appointment but i dont think i will tell her exactly how i feel.,0
i have never really been truthful with her and my psychiatrist about how suicidal i am.,0
"for example, about 1 month ago i tried to kill myself by oding on prescription medication and didnt tell my therapist until she actually asked me.",0
it seems like i am so wrapped up in not wanting people to know what is wrong with me that i dont want to let people in.,0
i have trust issues i guess as well as delusional disorder issues.,0
i am just so fed up with shit that i really see myself doing something tonight.,0
"ya, i know i can go to the hospital to help myself and be safe\xe2\x80\xa6 but i dont think i want to.",0
i have been waiting for 8 years.,0
how much longer must i suffer until i get better.,0
"i have tried them in the past with no help, usually ended up self harming afterwords.",0
"the hospital is something that i just can not stand, i have been their like 4 times in the past 2 years or so.",0
"i just get really delusional disorder, and end up harming myself more so then when outside of it.",0
"my family is not really there for support, and i really dont view them as family to begin with.",0
i feel no connection to them at all.,0
sometimes i know that if i were to kill myself no one would miss me.,0
dealing with the intrusive thoughts and the thoughts that i have myself just fucking cripples me.,0
i am to anxiety to do anything with anyone or be around anyone because of this fear.,0
"so i sit at home selfharming everynight, just hoping i die.",0
i wish i had better things to say about myself or my outlook but i just dont.,0
"this shit has been going on way too long, and i just dont have a will to live anymore.",0
i dont see how they can help me.,0
"i cant talk to them either, as i cant trust them.",0
it honestly doesnt matter to me though.,0
"my family knows, because the only reason i was let out of the hospital last time was because i agreed to let the doctors talk to my parents about my illness.",0
"i already live at home, so ya, but hurting my family with my death is not really a worry of mine.",0
and moving out or moving to a different place is not a realistic option or i have would have done it by now.,0
it just allows me to unstick my thoughts i guess.,0
no routines really calm down my anxiety.,0
"my hobbies, or i guess what i enjoy doing is listening to music, and playing video games.",0
"but other things i have tried havent really helped, such as reading/learning new things/working out.",0
"i was bullied in school mainly because i was always the youngest in the class, short, quiet, and a geek basically.",0
"i stopped using drugs, drinking, medication.",0
i have too many anxiety issues to be around people.,0
something that hasnt been brought up in therapy yet.,0
it doesnt bother me at this point.,0
i thought about the people that would miss me or be affected and the list has no one on it.,0
"everyone has left me, or i simply do not like them.",0
"i also should mentioned i checked out that yahoo group, and i dont know it just doesnt seem like my cup of tea.",0
i do appreciate your help though.,0
the thing is i have acted on them before.,0
the obsessive thoughts of harming myself.,0
i cant get a hold of dmt or i would have tried it.,0
"i went to one est treatment, and stopped after the one as i just didnt feel right.",0
"last i checked it was 4+ months for private ones, and 6+ for public ones.",0
it helps to get it off my chest.,0
"but, at the same time just makes me realize how messed my life is and why do i even bother continuing.",0
as i have told my therapist i could live a life with ocd as long as the violent intrusive thoughts of hurting myself or others would just stop.,0
as they are the root cause for the depression and the way i feel.,0
but i know that they wont stop.,0
i know that they will never go away.,0
"so, why bother sticking around just to cause more pain to myself?",0
killing myself is a logical solution to me.,0
i have nothing left that the depression hasnt taken from me.,0
i am not sure what help is left.,0
"going to hospitals and in-patient services have always caused me to come out worse, because they cause immense anxiety and stress issues the entire time i am there that i end up lying to get out as sharp pain as possible.",0
"medications have been ineffective thus far, and i wont take medications anymore because of the delusional disorder thoughts that i have about them.",0
"cant get another dog due to living at home, parents just want one.",0
the surgery really just freaks me out.,0
"i live in canada, on the east coast.",0
i took way too many pills mixed with alcohol and ended up throwing up :,0
"not much else to say, i am disappointed that i am still alive.",0
i just fear that the surgery is something so extreme.,0
like what if i am misdiagnosed.,0
"what if it doesnt work, and i end up worse off.",0
it just isnt something i could see myself doing.,0
it also isnt an option i can just choose to do either.,0
"my self harming has become so bad, that i am not sure why i even do it anymore to the point that i feel light headed.",0
it is out of control just like my ocd.,0
it seems everything in my life is out of control.,0
"ya, i mean i am going to tell my therapist that i am not doing so well.",0
"but, i already know what will happen.",0
"as soon as i say i am suicidal, but i dont want to go to a hospital because it makes things worse, they will get a court order again and force me there.",0
"regardless of what i say, i have no say in my treatment because they just see me as someone who is suicidal and where i live again the hospital is meant for short time stays.",0
and i cant just leave my job and drive 3+ hours on the hopes of getting into some clinic that i dont even want to go to in the first place.,0
"i know a psych ward/clinic is a place to stabilize and it may work for other people, but it just fucks me up even more.",0
"i also appreciate your help with these sites, but none of them and i havent found any yet that actually address or attempt to help with the intrusive thoughts that i have.",0
"i dont even talk about them here, or with my therapist so i dont even know how i would bring them up on a separate website.",0
i jusyt dont think sending this to her is a good idea because she willl know i have a plan and date and i can not go back to a hosptial.,0
i just feel like i am helpless because the things that i have tried and have offered to me just dont seem to help with my main symptoms.,0
"again, things do work for my other shit like checking doors, locks, cleaning, etc.",0
but for the main thing it doesnt help.,0
"i feel like i am wasting peoples time, because it eventually gets to the point where all that someone can say is give it more time, and i do, and nothing changes, and it just makes things worse.",0
"too make things even worse, it seems someone at my work noticed my write up, and i had a really fucking awkward meeting with hr.",0
told them everything was fine :,0
"i have tried calling the hotline here in canada, a few times with no real help.",0
i mainly lock up because i just get delusional disorder they are going to send someone to pick me up and force me back into a hospital.,0
"psychiatrist, therapist, parents i dont care about so it isnt an issue.",0
"as for being in shape, i would say i am average, 62 200lbs.",0
"again, ocd isnt going to be fixed through the same means as depression.",0
"i honestly dont know, and that is what makes me feel helpless, and hopeless/.",0
"because, i know that this works for the majority of people, and i just see it not working for me.",0
i feel like i let myself get this way.,0
"sorry been drinking, so i may make typoes.",0
i have searched for therapists basically within a 2 hour drive radius of where i live.,0
"i know my feeling feeling nervous and lack of trust is hindering me, but it is part of my ocd and delusional disorder delusions.",0
"i find it easier to talk over the internet due to the annonymity, the fact that i dont have to worry about being forced into a hospital, and i can talk to someone who has an understanding of what being depression is like.",0
"i am just so strung out from this shit that i dont know, i am just too concerned with what people will think or say that i am too embarrassed to go to the hospital as a factor.",0
"i know that i should say fuck it, but i just cant think that way or bring myself to do it.",0
i know i will probably end up dead if i dont get to one.,0
it is like i am standing in the headlights of the car and am just stuck not wanting to move knowing that i should move.,0
but i just dont see that happening.,0
but even then i dont see my mood changing or seeing how the therapy can help in the short term.,0
i know i should go to a hospital especially since i tried to od last night.,0
"murphwhitt, i have been on a high dose of something  for about 4 months or so before i stopped because my mood wasnt changing, and i felt myself feeling more numbness at times.",0
"i dunno, i have seen like 4-5 psychiatrists and they all say the same thing.",0
"i just feel completely hopeless, and feel like i am wasting peoples time i guess.",0
"there is, but i dont like being around the people there.",0
"so i just chill with my dog, and we seem to have fun.",0
"i want to get better, but i dont want to go to one.",0
i would seriously prefer to die.,0
the fatigue from thsi shit is unbearable.,0
i just want to self harm more tonight i just cant stop and it is a part that makes me feel more depression.,0
"it just sucks that my ocd feeds my depression and self harming, and the depression and self harming feeds the ocd.",0
i am just so terrified of hospitals/clinics that i would prefer the alternative of if i didnt go into one.,0
i just hate the way that i am treated in the hospital like a fucking child.,0
"well, i can see how it is confusing.",0
but it is just how i think i guess.,0
"always planning and thinking ahead, it is a part of the ocd really.",0
i try looking out into the futur adn dont really see myself geting better.,0
aso it just makes me more depression as shit and just wanting to cut becuase it is the only thin i have ever known.,0
"i have a dog and i love him to death, he has helped me through so much.",0
"i could email it to her, i dunno.",0
sorry for the typing i am slightly intoxicated right now.,0
"like this life i live sucks, fuck this shit.",0
"it has been, but they just dont seem to care about it.",0
my friends left me after they found out about my illness.,0
and i severely dislike my family members.,0
i just dont identify them as my family.,0
"i have called a hotline twice, both were quite frankly fucked.",0
"then the second time i called i was just clueless as to what to say or do, and it just ended up with the same bs of go to a hospital, your life is worth living etc.",0
"then when i mentioned i was self harming they asked if i was doing it right then, which i was, and said they couldnt continue to talk.",0
"i have never been honest with my therapist because i have major issues trusting people, which stem from being in junior high school.",0
i have told her truthfully once that i was thinking about suicide and she ended up having me committed to a hospital for about 1 month which didnt help me at all if anything it set me back.,0
"i guess my biggest fear is telling my therapist how i truly feel, and her sending me back to the hospital and me having to deal with the fallout from that.",0
as for the medication i have always been on high doses of every medication i have been on.,0
"a short list would be prozac, zoloft, celexa, luvox, seroquel, risperidone, zyprexa, zygess, geodon, haldol, and lithium is what i remember.",0
"obviously not being on those all at once, but ya.",0
i just am tired of the shit not working.,0
"like i havent even mentioned all the other shit that is going on, maybe i should\xe2\x80\xa6 i dont know.",0
i am just so fucked up that i dont tell anyone what is really going on because i am fearful that they will just run away.,0
"i wish i could say i would be safe tonight, but with how things are going i dont see that happening.",0
i see myself not ever getting better.,0
my psychiatrist wanted to see about sending me to some clinics in the us but havent heard back from that yet.,0
she mentioned i could try surgery to help my ocd but i dont want to risk the surgery fucking up and making me worse off then i am now.,0
"i dunno, i appreciate you talking with me though.",0
"i cant be around more then 2-3 people, as i end up having anxiety attacks.",0
plus seeing other people happy generally brings me down as it reminds me of what i havent felt.,0
slipping further away i guess.,0
last night was not a good night :,0
i loved someone once for 3 years.,0
they left me the minute i said i was depression :,0
i cant trust anyone anymore enough to even form a friendship let alone love.,0
i barely eat anymore as it is.,0
"i just needed to take a break, have a smoke and sleep, as i was getting a little down.",0
"i havent told my parents, and i know i wouldnt ever tell them.",0
it just isnt something i want to do.,0
i think a large part of me wants to die.,0
"but, a small part is preventing me from doing it and that small part is getting smaller and smaller with each passing hour and day.",0
"the thing is, is that i just dont care enough about them to even bother.",0
nor do i even really care much about myself.,0
"like i want to get help, but a large part of me is telling me that i am only getting help because that is what someone should do.",0
that large part is telling me to just do it and end it.,0
i am just so caught up in this illness that i dont know what is true anymore.,0
"that part gets smaller and smaller every day, and every hour.",0
"i have had bad experiences in the past with hotlines, and i cant bring myself to verbally say this shit to people.",0
"it just seems more real, if i speak about it, as opposed to typing it.",0
"plus, i dont want to be a burden on you i am not worth it.",0
"the situation is that essentially from the age of 5, when i started school, i have been bullied, depression, developing ocd, developing psychotic thoughts.",0
the ocd primary symptom is having extremely graphic and violent thoughts and mental images of harming myself and others.,0
they are too overwhelming and i cant keep dealing with them.,0
"i have tried numerous coping methods, but none have worked.",0
"ya, i dont think i can stress that i need a clinic because i will not be going to one.",0
"as for putting off killing myself, i just dont see that happening.",0
"as for parents, i just dont want to involve them.",0
"like as i said, i know that a hospital is safe.",0
but how can i get better in one if they cause too much stress and make me want to lie to get out.,0
"i just dont see the benefit in going to one, other than prolonging the amount of pain i am in.",0
i wish i had the courage to just cut deeper to end it.,0
"that is what people say, but i have been hoping for that for so long.",0
"how long do i suffer, for something that i have never seen.",0
i guess i can send this to my therapist.,0
again i cant go back to an institution.,0
my experiences in there have always been bad.,0
my first time going to one was when i was 13 after my first attempt and i was put in a safe room for about 1 month and just basically told that i was fine and i just tried cutting my arm open for attention.,0
"then i went back into one during the second year of university and was pumped full of drugs and sent home after 1 month still feeling the same way, i just wanted out.",0
the third time was about 2 months after i was released and the same shit told my psych i was still feeling depression and back in i went pumped full of more drugs then sent home feeling worse than before.,0
then the last time was sent there before i could attempt and put on more drugs then sent home.,0
"i just have lost hope in ever getting better, and just thinking about how fucked this past has been has made me want to pain myself even more.",0
i am at the point really where i cant handl;e anything anymore.,0
scared that if i tell the truth to my therapist that she will want to put me in a psych ward.,0
"i dont know, as you know my experiences with the hospital are terrible.",0
"where i live if you tell them you are suicidal you are sent straight to the psych ward, no real option.",0
"i just dont know what to do, if on monday it is just the same shit.",0
i really dont think i can handle that let down.,0
i dont want to go to a hospital but know i should because i know i am not safe\xe2\x80\xa6 i am messed up and these intrusive thoughts just arent helping.,0
"believe me, i have tried occupying my mind.",0
"these thoughts overpower it, and just cripple me emotionally and are to overwhelming to keep living with.",0
"i just needed to get some air, grab a drink, and clean a few cuts.",0
like i just dont know what to really say or tell.,0
"i have psychotic episodes that i dont really tell my therapist or psychiatrist about, or at least not the full extent of them.",0
"i dont tell them how every morning i wake up wanting to commit suicide, or that i have a plan, or even a date.",0
i am haunted and tormented by obsessive thoughts of violence towards others and myself that i just want to kill myself when they occur.,0
i havent told the therapist or psych about the delusional disorder thoughts/delusions that i constantly have.,0
the surgery just freaks me out because it is not guaranteed to work and it can cause other side effects such as memory loss and loss of intelligence.,0
"so here i sit, with a plan that i want to carry out but to feeling nervous to do it in case it fails and i have to go through to the hospital shit again, but who knows.",0
"yes, i dont have schizophrenia because i am aware of my thoughts, and have only been in full blown psychotic disorder a few times.",0
"i have had a brain scan, etc and everything checked out.",0
and i have researched my symptoms.,0
i have dedicated my school career to trrying to understand myself and find o,0
i have already tried to commit suicide twice a few years ago.,0
here the police are more concerned about lining their pockets first before helping their citizens.,0
i know i sound anti-patriotic but if you experienced my life on a daily basis then you would understand.,0
i have lived a fairly good life.,0
my family is wealthy but i had to leave and start my own life eventually.,0
my parents kinda blame me in a way.,0
they wont say it but their common cold attitude and reaction to me explains it all.,0
so im glad that i could actually get this out before i sank lower.,0
in a way it was a method of restoring my faith in humanity to know that people would at least acknowledge my pitiful cry even if i felt alone.,0
i dont really like therapists and such so i usually work out my own problems.,0
its almost as if im no longer tied to anything.,0
keep running and never return.,0
"truth be told, death is a way of dealing with a problem.",0
i sometimes get thoughts like .,0
i even fantasise about my death.,0
ive had ptsd for going on 40 years now.,0
its got progressively better for me.,0
i tried to kill myself twice -- and im very glad i failed.,0
"and i am so scared to leave him, because he has an awful family life and i feel like im his only support.",0
ive been keeping up this facade for almost two years.,0
i kept up a facade for my alcoholic parent for decades.,0
"and as a result, like nothing else, its directed my mind towards sub appropriate places.",0
"when i went through a sequence of misfortunes, my mind got twisted up and my perspective was horrifically distorted.",0
"i pain myself badly, as a result.",0
"however, with therapy, a new approach, massively reduced drinking and support ive now got a rational perspective on life.",0
"there is a lot of sadness, but thats ok.",0
sadness doesnt pain the way denial does.,0
my parents are barely functioning alcoholics.,0
i was raped at the beginning of this school year and no one believes me.,0
one of my parents is an alcoholic.,0
"i dont suffer from did, but i do have intrusive thoughts.",0
"im tired of trying so hard just to have friends, someone to talk to.",0
"i have a superiority complex, despite my self image, i look down upon people.",0
"when i look into the mirror i see nothing but disgust, an image that i dont want to present to people.",0
i dont want to be the person i look down upon myself.,0
"i did not email, call, or talk to my ex.",0
im a loser in every sense of the word,0
"i tried to kill myself when i was 19, and im now really glad i failed.",0
"as an adult child of an alcoholic, i am very familiar with the grinding anxiety and the judgement that gets flung around in an alcoholic family.",0
as someone who has suffered from depression for 40-odd years i know that sometime it is rough.,0
as a long term sufferer from cptsd,0
cptsd and ongoing abuse is a dreadful mix.,0
ive had a friend in the past who really wasnt a friend at all.,0
"i wanted to end my life over something so stupid i laugh at it now, maybe mine wasnt as terrible but i still thought of suicide.",0
"its embarrassing being an adult living with your parents, working part time at a minimum wage job.",0
i lived with my parents until i was 27.,0
i feel as if i am a huge disappointment who can do nothing right whenever i do something for someone which is almost every day i get told how i screwed it up or how it could be better,0
ive tried to commit suicide twice and i failed both times.,0
no family  ill tell people this from time to time and they really dont get it.,0
if i kicked the bucket tomorrow there would be nobody at my funeral-for real!,0
its so confusing and heartbreaking sometimes though.,0
its strange not being connected to anyone at all.,0
its crazy how much we need that.,0
"well i have no family , i recently got out of an eight year relationship and lost all my friends in the process, i have no money.",0
i look around the world and feel like it could be a lot worse.,0
but really there is nobody in the world that loves me.,0
been waiting to feel like a woman for 30 years.,0
"i tried, failed and was committed when i was 16.",0
so many people out there that feel the same way i feel right now:,0
hopeless and also feeling tired  i guess theres comfort in that.,0
i wanted to die for a multitude of reasons when i was 20.,0
i tried when i was 16 and failed.,0
i tried to commit suicide once.,0
things havent gotten better but i am just too scared to try again.,0
"when they work, they completely eradicate my social anxiety.",0
i sometimes have a lot of trouble with coming down though.,0
sometimes no matter what i take i feel stuck in a state of avolition or anhedonia.,0
"adderall completely alleviates my social anxiety and makes me feel like a normal person with a full spectrum of emotions, heavily weighted towards the good ones.",0
taking adderall allowed me to understand what life is like without depression.,0
i went to two doctors and asked if i could get a prescription for it to treat my depression.,0
i took a test to see if i had adhd.,0
this all happened a few years ago.,0
i stopped trying to go to doctors because the ones i went to were mean and it was an embarrassing experience.,0
i dont know why it isnt prescribed for depression.,0
i dont have the motivation to see doctors anymore.,0
i never found an anti-depressant that helped me and i stopped trying a long time ago.,0
dangerously unstable myself right now and the only thing keeping me from following through with shit is going on reddit to talk to people in the same boat.,0
how can i fall asleep and not wake up,0
that once im drunk enough im hanging myself from this perfect hook next to the hotels tv,0
i could have said one word and reached out for help months ago and avoid 95% of the shit thats going on right now.,0
but i let it snowball and snowball.,0
"i feel like a robot, everything you said makes sense to me, but -and please dont take this wrong way- it does not help.",0
"its not your fault, how can anybody on the internet know exactly my situation without me explaining it all.",0
i feel like ive heard all the right things fr you and others but tears are still running and the bad thoughts are very frontal,0
the way the take care of you is dope you up on drugs to the point where you are psychically unable to do anything.,0
"if you dope me enough to the point i dont know what a knife is, i guess thats help.",0
"they will not be rehabilitate me, they do whats required to get you checked out safely, because then its not their problem.",0
"if i went to a hospital with cuts on my wrists, they would stich me up and send me on my way.",0
i finished my therapy session.,0
im still a little unstable though i have these waves of emotions that try and drown out everything she told me.,0
"i wouldnt say im cured, i still have dark thoughts.",0
"its awesome that her, you, ad others are here for help, but i cant have 100 convos going while trying to drink and die lol",0
"im going to post here if i live, and i will be giving you credit, you are the only one who has given me advice to think about.",0
on my thread the deleted comments come from someone who asked me to do it for their entertainment and i momentarily lost faith in talking to people here.,0
"its cool to know people care, i just dont think it will be enough.",0
"once im gone, please try and get ahold of my family so you can explain what i went through.",0
you seem to legitly concerned.,0
"after my two failed attempts and sitting in my parents guest room; i have not received a hug, have not been told im loved, have not been asked if im going to be ok.",0
i havent eaten since they got me  and the only thing my mother has said is  without even looking at me.,0
i know what i put her through is horrible but im still pretty fucking unstable and if shes mad at me she should try and at least hide it cuz its only intensifying my feelings,0
yea whatever reddit works fine.,0
"i cant believe i fooled everyone, i even got the cops involved in a big talk about mma that tottaly pushed the focal point off me.",0
i basically said sorry and it wont happen and they let me go.,0
its the only reason ive made it so far lol,0
only way to prevent it from happening 20 years from now as supposed to today,0
"thanks, but only i know how i feel as im sitting this this hotel.",0
"im not hopin to be rescued, but shit, i think everyones attempt at reaching me lasted 3 hours.",0
i could call someone right now and be dead before they eventually made their way over here.,0
"they all think im just being a brat and runnin away, i dont think the word suicide will cross their mind until a few days have passed.",0
a lot of people would have killed to have my life without making the mistakes i did.,0
"hospital says imnot a risk, cops take me to jail.",0
hospital considers me a risk and i stay here until im  then go to jail.,0
i shoulda ended it when i had the chance,0
"my life is a pile of shit and i have about 4 1/2 hours before i do this, and you say take a shower.",0
"that may work with somebody who had a bad day, not a bad life.",0
"i feel bad your in the same pain i am, but trust me, your really not helping me here.",0
if she had not got my location and called the cops i would probably be in a coma.,0
because people only give a fuck about you when your dead.,0
dont tell me you would want to hear about my life if i wasnt suicidal.,0
"im not trying to be a dick, but you cemented my feelings of people only wanting to hear about others troubles for their own interest.",0
the only person who will care will be me when i decide to take the final shot into the afterlife,0
"hospital stay, cop car, mom and dad, all that bullshit.",0
"i really just dont give a shit anymore, i spent sooo much time and energy preparing for my death in that hotel.",0
my dad made me a therapist appointment tonight and im just gunna tell him what they want to hear so i can leave.,0
i made a post to suicide watch titled  as a way of thanking her for saving me.,0
but they deff have enough to put me in jail.,0
the cops are nice but the hospital staff are dicks im sitting here awaiting my fate when i just wish i could be dead,0
girlfriend already said she never wants to see me againparents:,0
dad will prob punch me and mom will refuse to let me staypolice:,0
i will be put in jailhospital:,0
ill be treated then put in jail,0
i havent eaten in 2 days comming up on 3.,0
im litteraly not hungry and i couldnt force myself to eat right now if i tried.,0
my feeling are only being sub-sided by talking here.,0
i dont have a person who will actually listen to me.,0
well i guess this therapist might but i doubt ill feel any better tonight.,0
i dont feel like drowning myself but a glass of weisers would do wonders for my head.,0
"i thought the  mind state was not good but given my situation, it might save me from a heart attack.",0
its hard to type my fingers are tremor,0
the last thing i want you to feel is gulit.,0
if anything youve made my last hours easier,0
i was only ever trying to help and he was trying me make me look like an ass.,0
"i apologize for offending you that way, i understand its not my place to tell you what you can and cant do.",0
"however that is how i feel, and i only expressed that to you as a  because i though it might help save your life.",0
my gf of 6 years broke half my shit when she saw i left.,0
she thought i was breaking up with her.,0
the last text i got from her before i passed out the first time is  so i think that ship has sailed.,0
kind of ironic those were almost the last words i ever read.,0
my support system is crumbled and im not strong enough to carry on in life alone.,0
the only control i have in my life right now is wether i want to continue it.,0
i just dont see how my life can be normal after this.,0
suicide has been the only thing on my mind for the last 3 months.,0
"2 failed attempts, police escorts, hospital stay, mom who im sure would help set up my noose, and my dad breaking my heart with what he thinks is care.",0
i dont think my sister knows yet but holy shit is that going to be another wave of emotion i cant handle.,0
"if i cant figure my shit out soon, then im doing people a favour by killin myself.",0
"what if i have a wife who dosent work, 3 kids, and a grand kid and these feelings come back.",0
i dont want anybody to get anymore emotionally involved in me because ive damaged them enough already.,0
and that wasent even enough to change my mind state.,0
like what the fuck i think i need to be in a padded room or something.,0
"i fear when i get misunderstood that one last time, ill pain someone else instead of me.",0
"i start to feel better, then look at my situation, and add more gulit for trying to brush it off.",0
i dont even know if im making sense right now,0
that seems like a mountain i dont have the gear to climb.,0
"im sorry if i make no sense, im suiciadal myself and dont know if any of my advice counts because i cant even follow it myself.",0
"i failed twice and after being revived,i saw a small portion of the potential damage i would have cause if i had died.",0
im in a hospital room waiting to decide if i get released,0
if i make it through this ill be a broken man,0
ill take you up on that if im alive tomorrow,0
as soon as i feel them kick in ill be taking the big dose.,0
its a shame im unae to help myself.,0
well it didnt work im back in the same room about to fall alseep forever,0
"ive fucked over everyone in my life and take small comfort in people who dont know me, telling me nice things.",0
"if you knew half the shit ive done, you would kill me yourself.",0
"you want somebody to ignore the pain your in, and go on a vacation with the last of your money.",0
every day just brushing off the fact that in a few days you are going to end you life.,0
"yes there is a future for me, but its pretty bleak at this point.",0
"gf of 6 yrs i was going to marry left, and ill forever be the pussy black sheep of the family.",0
everyone around me will be walking on eggshells and constantly trying to avoid saying things that might push me over the edge.,0
doesnt sound as appealing as a rope right now lol,0
it feels pointless putting anything inside me.,0
im going to try and watch a movie or something.,0
my head is racing bad i need to stop thinking about shit for awhile.,0
spare me the usual bullshit of why y loved ones love me.,0
it dosent help because its not true.,0
im loosing time before ill be kicked out if here i fear i dont have enough booze.,0
"dont feel guilt, its all i ask",0
i rather die in a hole then in that place with drug addicts and annoyed staff.,0
i just had my first session today after my attempt and it really helped.,0
"yea,  i get through this ill either be on a lifetime sucicide watch from everyone i know, or ill have to leave my old life behind and start a new one just so i can have people that trust me 100% .",0
im just saying all my  options lead to bad news,0
if your so concerned about what will happen in real life how about you leave me the fuck alone because youve already made me cry and i thought i got all my tears out over the last few weeks.,0
i guess i forgot people on the internet dont give a fuck,0
im doing whatever i can to get the fuck out of this place.,0
twice as depressing as my hotel room.,0
i dont even know if im going to jail,0
"man tries to od on pills and booze, fails.",0
"goes buy more booze, plan to finish it, once im drunk ill find something to hang myself with.",0
i hope at least your interested was filled.,0
"oh it will, i just received a death threat from my gf and she never wants to see me again.",0
im just trying to make them happy the only way they have expressed would.,0
ive basically done the ultimate betrayal to everyone in my life.,0
imagine doing that to everyone you,0
"i really dont care, i cant care about anything cept talking to some people before i die",0
"there is no way in hell im reaching out to my mom, i dont need to hear about how shitty of a son i am for putting her through this.",0
"my dad cares but hes tottaly clueless on what to do, cant blame him though.",0
i think if i opened up to him he would try and give me money or something material to make me feel better.,0
"every crisis ive been through my dad just immediately paid for it, i have no sense of value of money.",0
wow saying that out loud makes me feel like a even bigger peice of shit lol.,0
im going to a therapist in 3 hours.,0
"hopefully i dont lie to him, its really the only thing im good at.",0
i guess because im a giant it didnt work.,0
i dont feel that euforic sense of a second chance.,0
"i had my gf, parents, friends all thinking i was a welders helper going to school for welding, and never need help from anybody.",0
i would sit in my car with a bottle looking over a bridge debating if i should drive off it; while everyone thought i was at school.,0
you can imagine how many different and daily lies you need to tell to keep that shit up.,0
"i dont know how to be honest, especially when my true feeling are changing every five mins.",0
do i tell this therapist i want to jam his pencil in my neck?,0
do i tell him i think my mom is a peice of shit and being around her is not healthy for me?,0
"probably not, ill probably just say all the right things and have him wondering why i even came.",0
"like when people call themselves compulsive liars, they do it for a reason.",0
"i lie easier then i breath, its like when im confronted about my emotions my brain goes to defence mode and blocks everyone out",0
ive been in some pretty bad places in my life.,0
ive done some really bad things.,0
ive tried killing myself before.,0
ive been hospitalized 3 times.,0
im just so unbelievably depression and nothing is helping and i dont know what to do.,0
i called my therapist yesterday and he was not helpful at all and now i dont even think i want to go to my next appointment.,0
i just left a voicemail canceling.,0
i dont know if ill go back at all,0
i called a hotline last night.,0
i dont have friendsi dont want to bother you with im,0
my suicide note is just a postit with my pgp password,0
i have some really extreme issues with delusional disorder when it comes to privacy about my mental health.,0
i think i have pretty good reasons for this because ive been pain really badly before.,0
"i cant go into why specifically, but it really limits my ability to talk to anyone because i cant trust anyone.",0
if i knew anyone who gave a shit do you think id be posting about this on reddit?,0
"i cut a bit, but didnt od on all the pills i have here.",0
super worn out going to sleep in a bit,0
"im not sure if your goal was to make yourself seem even crazier than me, but you seem to have succeeded.",0
i have a psychiatrist who i see for therapy.,0
ive seen more than 25 therapists in my lifetime.,0
more therapist isnt going to help muchside note:,0
other people are getting jobs so there must be something wrong with me which is causing me not to get them.,0
didnt say being crazier than me was easy.,0
been dealing with depression as long as i can remember.,0
worked my butt off in school and the expensive of everything else.,0
my school doesnt officially do class rank but as far as i can tell i am top of my class both in terms of in the field exp and gpa.,0
job situation is nonetheless bleak.,0
i poured all of my energy into building a good career foundation and it doesnt mean shit.,0
more apathy would probably just help me kill myself.,0
"ive been seriously depression for many years, also.",0
"not trying to be mean, but being suicidal myself has wiped out my need to gently coax people into being open to whats attainable.",0
i started anti-dp treatment this morning.,0
i just had the worst night filled with ala ripper victorian horror nightmares.,0
"im alive but i still dont see where im heading now, i feel ive been doing so much wrong around me all my life, hurting myself and those who tried to love me.",0
"i was just trying to get it right by myself, out of pride, like a selfish bitch that i am.",0
i didnt want chemical help because i see this as weak .,0
"im trying hard to relax, surrounded by records and smith the cat .",0
"i guess that moving from /r/suicidewatch to /r/depression/ can be called a success, somehow.",0
"i now have an additionnal therapist, my relatives are trying their best not to leave me by myself those few first days of treatement, but id like to keep on conversing here too, as i realized i feel more confortable online.",0
maybe someday i can return the favor.,0
"i started ad treatment after refusing it for years, maybe i wanted to prove myself i could overcome this on my own.",0
but the results are what they are:,0
my pride led me to failure in my professional and personal life.,0
i never gave up before though.,0
"im recovering from an attempt to take my life, and just started treatment.",0
"i dont know what will turn out of it, but i know for sure im better at helping others than myself.",0
im aware of the time it takes to kick in.,0
they were prescribed by a new psychiatrist i started seeing.,0
the hard time is before/after sleep.,0
"for now, i just cant begin to forgive myself.",0
"i dont want to be a victim, but then it means its all my fault.",0
someone i really cared about left because she couldnt deal with my anxiety.,0
"i just started taking those just a few days ago , because i tried to kill myself.",0
i have a hard time writing this down.,0
"first i thought about ways of doing it, i still dont know if i really wanted to die, but the fact is i ended emptying a full bottle of benzodiazepine with alcool.",0
i just wanted the pain to go away.,0
"imo, crisis is a state of mind, a total loss of confidence between people and what they can do for each other as a group or society.",0
im unemployed myself and cant figure out how to saddle up again.,0
i considered taking a one-way ticket just like you.,0
"until it started to get at me, like bad.",0
"i just had the revelation that what i liked doing for a living was bad for me, because of the environment that went with it.",0
"im 34 now, just started recovering from a suicide attempt, started treatment this morning and realized i have no idea who i am or what im gonna be for the rest of my life.",0
"for now, i feel like im barely standing on this first step.",0
"thanks for the meditation thingy, ill give it a try.",0
i guess shes right in a certain way.,0
i wont try anything before i feel real changes in me.,0
"as i wrote, i dont blame her for preserving herself, shes been through as much as anyone, regarding death and illness.",0
shes reachable but things were said that we cant take back.,0
she willingly broke the line so i cant get hold onto her.,0
"i gotta get myself up again, but even if i succeed im afraid to face all the good things that could have happened to me before that i just fucked up because of, sorry for that, what i cant resign myself to call illness.",0
"i always tried hard to  myself, i always end up alone in fear and anxiety.",0
"ive been depression on and off for years, now.",0
i feel that all my choices in life are based on something that im not.,0
i now believe that it is the true cause of my depression.,0
"im over 30, had big expectations put on me very early, and failed at building a career or personal life.",0
"cant tell all this to anyone i know because, well, having lived with it for so long, i learned to hide it and im still this smart-funny-pleasant dude, and im scared to show my true self, not being taken seriously.",0
"the last failure was a personal one, the girl i lived with for months and truly believe is the one, because she was able to see me.",0
"she left a month ago, right after what she saw was how anxiety i could get.",0
"i cant blame her for not being by my side in this, she has her own problems and felt unsecure around me.",0
"after losing her, i felt like nothing could ever be right again, so i crossed the bridge.",0
"i blacked out from the pills and alcool, but woke up, so i tried to go get some more, the rest is fuzzy.",0
"i got help from my family, somehow.",0
"i still feel the same, i hope therapy and treatment will help.",0
"hope is all ive left, but sometimes i wish i had none, so i could be relieved.",0
"i cant remember well writing this, because i had already started popping bzdzpm down with booze at the time.",0
"curiously enough, writing something here was to me the most appropriate way to express what i felt, although i practicly never do.",0
i finally got to reason to get help.,0
im writing this because for the few people that took a moment of their attention to focus on my distress.,0
"it made me realize i lack the ability to express my inner pain, and it could have come to something that should not have happened.",0
i had never in my wholelife considered something that extreme before.,0
i feel failure so deep in my life that it seems i cant even end it properly.,0
i dont know if my problem is the result of my situation or the opposite.,0
"im depression because i failed at everything because im depression because, etc.",0
most people in life are not equipped with the skills to survive.,0
so how do most of us make it thru to the next day?,0
"ive seen this sad\\happy chain of events happen all the time, including myself.",0
"i broke up with my fiance last night, for real.",0
that was hard to write just now.,0
i know the feeling of waking up and the reality kicks in.,0
i can also tell you ive tried to take pills and that was enough for me to realize that i do not want to do that to myself ever again.,0
"i was 15 at the time, and i still remember listening to fade to black by metalica and feeling like the world turned its back on me.",0
"it feels that way again for me, but i think its necessary to complete my true feelings and to acknowledge how i owned the relationship.",0
during my twenties and early thirties i always felt my my mind was idling higher than normal and getting high or drinking took the edge off.,0
i did this everyday for most of my life since my parents were in to it and  seemed to always be around.,0
"when i would stop using, my mind would race off again and i gained the pills and knife you had and made attempts that did not work.",0
the act of trying was enough for me to finally learn i didnt want to go thru with it.,0
"i wonder if its chemicals balanced in my head, current events like a job, relationship, family, etc.",0
i wonder if my thinking may pour the wrong chemicals in to the soup and this brings me closer to depression.,0
"yes, i get depression but i know myself, and only myself can get me out a hole like that.",0
my father molested my sister and both parents were on psychedelics.,0
"i had tried suicide when i was young and for the most part i gave up on life, but like a cat i somehow always land back on my oedema of extremity.",0
"i couldnt have sex with the person i loved most until years later after the mess had cleared, and time had sealed some wounds with scar tissue.",0
"hi, im new to this sub  and like most of the people here, suicidal.",0
ive tried to kill myself before so i know the feeling that comes after a failed attempt.,0
ive also felt like my parents hated me growing up but as i grew older i found that they were just people with their own problems like everyone else.,0
i remember that quote every time i feel suicidal.,0
my dad has called me all kinds of shit:,0
"lazy, pussy, mean mood and berates me every chance he gets.",0
its pushed me so close to the end you wouldnt believe it.,0
death is the only thing that will stop this ache and anger and undesire to live.,0
they say if you commit suicide you to straight to hell.,0
its the only reason why i havent this far.,0
im just so social fear to go to hell,0
having this type attention till the end really is helping though.,0
better than listening to sam smith stay with me over and over again,0
then look at which things i definitely need to pay off first before buying anything like food.,0
"after bottling up my mental depression slowly over the years, one night i just bought alot of alcohol to just make me numbness for that evening.",0
"in my overdraft, credit card debt and unemployed right now.",0
was at a job as well where i wasnt terribly good and fairly depressed mood during that time not really knowing where the hell i was going.,0
although i havent tried the theanine supplements alone.,0
is there good evidence that caffeine is contraindicated for bipolars?,0
"1that however much i crave death, i still have work to do on this earth.",0
"im not worried about her, im worried about me!",0
"i havent seen my shrink in a long time, but i have an appointment.",0
thank youfor the probing questions.,0
i think i learned a lot writing this.,0
that went right over her head.,0
"but i was wrong, you cant just buy a bullet.",0
she is clueless and insensitive.,0
"after all, says she, the ache of losing a college buddy is nothing compared to a father and a brother!",0
"i showed it to her, and she didnt get it.",0
"wont kill myself, because i never want to make anyone feel the way i feel now.",0
"it put me into deep depression, like staying in bed all day.",0
"i spend hours pacing back and forth thinking through porjects, but i dont finish them.",0
"im not even entirely sure of what the facts are, since both sides are determined to spin things their way.",0
"also im not really in the right frame of mind to verify all of this, and my recollection of the exact order of events might be a bit hazy.",0
"i should point out, im biased towards the gamer side.",0
"at this point, gamers started demanding answers, but many games journalists simply responded by calling gamers misogynists alledging that they only cared about zoes relationships, because she is a woman.",0
now heres where it gets weird.,0
"as you might suspect this angered a lot of gamers, and was the event that really kicked off gamergate.",0
"at some point, someone had the idea of trying to cut the journos funding, and so they started sending mass emails to the advertisers, persuading them not to support people that were trying to kill gamers.",0
"the entire thing essentially turned into a pr war, /v/ began policing themselves quite heavily, so as not to give the other side ammunition.",0
that they couldnt use gender and race as a shield to hide their misdeeds behind.,0
"this turned out to be quite an effective blow for the gamers, at least in the short term, it seemed to disarm a lot of the journalists arguments, but many of them still stuck to the misogynist line.",0
i think now theyre claiming that the minorities on #notyourshield are being controlled by white people on 4chan.,0
"theyre trying to negotiate with the gamers, calling for peace, but it likely wont work.",0
"throughout all of this, 4chan has been doing some digging, its difficult to know what info to trust, but they assert that a p.",0
"some people on the gamer side have compared the journos to a cult, in the way that they keep pushing dogma but wont listen to reason.",0
"also, theres a lot of people in the gaming industry who seem afraid to speak up.",0
theyre essentially social justice warriors.,0
thats quite a lot of info and i still havent included everything.,0
"zoe apparently tried to sabotage a feminist charity that was helping women get into gaming, called the fine young capitalists.",0
"4chan has been donating to them and submitting  in order to make themselves seem more ophthalmia, sympathetic to women and feminists.",0
"youd think he was just some random person looking for attention, but apparently hes some 80-year old, pro debater that spends most of his time on capcom-forums arguing about street fighter.",0
"if youre really interested, his tweets give an interesting overview of the situation.",0
"im quite tired, so i apologise for any spelling/grammatical errors.",0
"i dont think ill get shadowbanned, but some of this stuff has been quite heavily censored on reddit.",0
"none of this has any direct relevance to me, ive been following it closely, but i havent intervened.",0
the whole situation just upsets me.,0
"ive been depressed mood for a long time, and suicidal too.",0
"years ago, i dropped out of university following a suicide attempt.",0
"since then, ive lived with my parents for the last half-decade.",0
"ive been to doctors for the sake of my mental health, but no treatment has ever helped me.",0
"im extremely socially isolated, with severe phobia, social anxiety.",0
"i tried to combat it, and made some progress in the short-term, but eventually i failed and ended up backsliding.",0
"these days, i rarely leave the house.",0
i have had no friends for a long time.,0
"i have never been in a relationship, nor do i ever expect to enter one.",0
"i decided that i would learn c++, develop a game, single-handedly, and then try to sell it online.",0
"i knew it would take years, with just me working on my own, and i wasnt expecting it to be easy.",0
"but since sitting around wasnt going to help, i bought a few books on the subject, downloaded a compiler, and taught myself how to program.",0
"it took me a while to learn, but eventually i was making progress, figuring stuff out.",0
"despite my lack of energy, things were starting to go well, i had programmed something that was almost beginning to look like the bare bones of a game.",0
"then gamergate happened, and i just cant deal with it.",0
"for the past few weeks, ive just been watching the only hope i had ventricular dysfunction, left crumble in front of my eyes.",0
"the extent of the alleged corruption, the behaviour of the journalists and devs involved, it all sickens me.",0
"the worst thing is, i cant even distract myself by playing videogames because they remind me of whats going on.",0
i just cant find the focus or the energy to do it.,0
"its so stupid, but i think thisll be the thing that finally pushes me over the edge.",0
"im going to wait until gamergate is over, just so i can see how it all ends.",0
"after that, im going to kill myself.",0
"im sorry, but i dont see the point.",0
i already feel like ive spent too long enduring things.,0
"i think ive picked up enough knowledge to pass an interview, but i suspect itd be difficult to demonstrate competency without having contributed to any actual projects.",0
"the real problem that i face, is that many developers calling themselves indie, werent really independant at all.",0
"you disagree, but without knowing my circumstances.",0
"do you believe that they are always false, under any circumstances?",0
at the very least ill see how gamergate goes before i commit to killing myself.,0
especially if they connect these posts to my real identity.,0
"they wouldnt actually be able to prevent me from selling a game, but theyd be able to make it difficult.",0
"alternatively, youtubers have been cutting into journalists profits quite heavily, or so ive heard.",0
i just dont want to involve myself with it any more.,0
"normal corruption almost feels honest, compared to this pushing an ideology stuff.",0
i havent tried to commit suicide since march 2013.,0
i still have suicidal thoughts.,0
"ive been there, and am suicidal often.",0
im $36k deeper in debt because of a  that was unlicensed at the hospital i was taken to.,0
i have none and im still trying.,0
ive never been diagnosed with anything.,0
"right now, my goal is to tell that cunt and liar doctor that i paid off my debt and they lost their license because of me.",0
"not plausible, but its a goal.",0
"and, if they believe in their bullshit, they win!",0
i fought hard and im not dead.,0
sounds like a petty life.,0
"but, im alive and i have a goal.",0
he got social fear as shit once and called the cops.,0
"when he learned that it didnt help and started costing me money, he started listening.",0
"im still suicidal, and its better, i guess.",0
"i love my dad for it, and im not calling him again.",0
he was willing to put himself in harm to save my life.,0
i hate that i cant repay him because im still suicidal.,0
"hes helping pay-off the medical bills, though.",0
"ill, eventually, let him down.",0
"i dont like living, either.",0
"if its green, you just got a new internet friend.",0
i realize an internet-friend isnt worth a damn.,0
"but, im replying to the same subreddit youre reading.",0
"everyone else, theyre assholes that dont get it.",0
were all just reaching-out and hoping somebody cares.,0
"but, ill listen and try to help because ive gone broke  for my problems from assholes across the medically-licensed usa.",0
"it should be non-sexual, because sex and love two completely diferent things to me.",0
i would like to embrace somebody who would spend as much time thinking about me and being loyal beside me as i do about him/her.,0
"i want to be fully accepted as a human, thats what i wish for.",0
i enjoy playing video games with my friends.,0
but its kind of weird laughing while playing while wishing to be dead.,0
even in these moments the core of my souls is sad.,0
i dont believe they value our friendship as much as i do.,0
"in the near future i plan moving from this home to my own place because my family has a huge negative impact on my feelings, i am not sure if this helps enough to be fine though, bit its a first step",0
"it was my mother who forced me to learn for an exam in school, at the same time i had an arguement with my best friends and we hated each other, i did not see any future for me and maybe it was more hormonic back then.",0
"after the suicide attempt, my mother lied to the hospital that it was no suicide attempt but an accident.",0
so it burned in my mind a long time,0
"death does not mean mood resting, you will never think/feel anything again",0
yeah no one really knows what to say when it comes to being suicidal.,0
"its really unfortunate, because that usually stops them from even trying.",0
im just going to put my mask back on and try to pretend like im enjoying things.,0
"and yeah, in my scenario it would definitely be a no as well.",0
i need to get out there and meet more people.,0
"ive never been in a relationship, and thats something i really want, sooner rather than later.",0
i feel like 21 is too old to be going on a first ever date :,0
and i mean mood early morning.,0
went and visited my grandmother for the weekend.,0
was planning on messaging you.,0
its been kind of a depressed mood week.,0
"ive lost most of my friends because of this stupid bullshit that im going through, and im just frustrated.",0
i dunno if or when things are going to blow over.,0
"i messed around in my closet again, seeing if i had the courage to actually go through with it, but i didnt.",0
it would absolutely kill my parents i think.,0
"so ive just been keeping on, riding it out.",0
"i have seen a hypersomnia doctor about it, but i didnt tell him i was suffering from depression.",0
"for some reason my parents were allowed in the room, even though im 18, and i dont want them knowing about it.",0
yeah expectations and comparing myself to others are two of the biggest problems i have.,0
"i tend to put other people on pedestals, which definitely makes things harder on myself.",0
"it means that any problems there are in the friendship must be my fault, and i just end up feeling like crap.",0
im pretty excited to start dbt though.,0
for the first time in a long time im feeling somewhat hopeful about the chances of getting over this.,0
it just seems so permanent when youre going through it.,0
thanks so much for responding.,0
"while i do think the hospital isnt the right place for me, it has gotten me connected more quickly with therapy groups and the like, which is a good thing i suppose.",0
"i just feel like being there is a complete waste of time though, especially when it makes me miss my job.",0
"my main thing with hospitals i guess is i go in and tell them i feel entirely powerless, so they stick me in a hospital gown, take away everything except maybe a book, and for all intents and purposes show me what its really like to be powerless.",0
"ive been around that block a few times though, and know what to avoid saying if i want to stay out of the hospital.",0
"and no, i havent heard of dbt.",0
"ive dabbled in cbt a bit, but i hate it, mainly because there are right answers to all the questions.",0
im willing to give pretty much anything a shot.,0
"thanks for your support, but i just feel so trapped.",0
"i cant get over the fact that if i made different choices, if i had gone to the same university as my friends, or gotten proper treatment sooner, or what have you, my life would be much more enjoyable right now.",0
"im just paralysed by regret, and i honestly dont think it will ever go away.",0
"the new therapist seemed pretty ok, but it was only my introductory session.",0
"im not really a religious person, but i feel every religion has a pretty ok secular morals side to it.",0
im going to start running again i think.,0
i miss being in even slightly ok shape.,0
"i lost a lot of weight recently, but thats just because my appetite has been terrible.",0
"i figure if i stick to just drinking water though, i can start eating properly again and keep some of the weight off.",0
yeah most of my friends havent really said what they would do if i were to kill myself.,0
they just hate talking to me about it for fear that something they say will make everything worse.,0
"they dont really understand, and dont seem to be willing to listen, which gets frustrating for both parties.",0
its just that being depressed mood and feeling suicidal has just become more or less my identity.,0
"its what i spend all my time doing, and i lose ways to relate to them.",0
"theyre all off in school, most of them still in engineering, and whenever i see them and they start to talk about school i just feel like crap.",0
"im immediately filled with regret that i chose to not go to the same university, among a number of other things.",0
"and it really sucks, because one of these friends is someone ive wanted to ask out for a long time, but she gets really annoyed at me when im in a bad mood and says it makes her feel guilty, and just isnt willing to talk things over.",0
"shes been avoiding me for the past while, which hurts quite a lot.",0
"im the type of person who just completely attaches himself to someone or something, and its just immensely frustrating that i put myself through this even though i know better.",0
"ive had pretty vivid dreams about some pretty weird things, and have woken up only to not feel rested at all.",0
"i finally saw a hypersomnia doctor, and it turns out i have alpha wave intrusions, a hypersomnia disorder that basically means my hypersomnia isnt deep or refreshing.",0
"there is medication for this, but i cant attest to how well it works because im currently trying to avoid it by following a list of techniques to ensure a better nights hypersomnia.",0
"im still fighting with it, but at least now i know what im fighting.",0
"hey i think you misunderstood, i cant commit suicide because it would crush my parents.",0
im not thinking about depressed mood anyone besides myself.,0
"ive stayed away from knives, but i have tried to hang myself multiple times with my belt.",0
"its just sort of an urge i get, and doing something about it makes it go away.",0
each time ive been pushing myself a bit further.,0
"my parents have since confiscated my belt however, so ive been pretty safe for the past week or so.",0
"im also struggling with it, but when i made this post i was feeling suicidal, and talking to people who understand is a really good outlet, at least for me.",0
"| its just a constant sensation, like the ticking of a clock.",0
"its always there, but when you notice it it gets really fucking loud.",0
"the thing is, it doesnt matter what im doing.",0
im fundamentally a broken person.,0
going to africa would just result in me feeling shit in africa.,0
"that being said, since this post ive seen a new psychologist, whos recommended a new type of therapy for me, called dbt, which im going to look into.",0
"for the first time in a long time, im actually feeling somewhat hopeful about the possibility of getting better, but well see how it goes.",0
depression and being suicidal arent things you can just shake off.,0
its not anything as petty as outside events.,0
"i find most things that allow me to think just put me in a depressed mood mood, music being one of them.",0
"im currently looking into therapy, as expensive as it is.",0
"ive tried it and hated it before, but i dont have a hell of a lot of options here.",0
i dunno im just really exhaustion.,0
ive been sleeping a lot more recently.,0
gotta try and get myself back on track.,0
i somehow managed to get a drug abuse paying job despite my lack of qualifications.,0
"none of my friends really understand why i want to die, and whenever i go to them for help they get anger at me for making them feel guilty.",0
"this constant feeling of pain, or regret, or hopelessness, or what have you.",0
coming here was actually the best thing ive done to help in a long time.,0
"ive calmed down for now, but ill take you up on it for sure.",0
its just a really hectic time for me.,0
thanks so much for taking the time to read this and be there.,0
i just need someone to talk to.,0
i just need to get my thoughts out there to someone who will listen and not freak out.,0
"ive been to a new psychologist, and hes recommended a new type of therapy called dialectical behaviour therapy for me.",0
i think my main problem is deeper than the circumstances im in.,0
"i think, in fact, its caused most of the problems i have.",0
"i dont really know what i want to be, or even who i am.",0
"my life so far has just been a set of tracks that ive been following, and i just chose engineering because it was the next logical step for a successful drug abuse school student.",0
"i dont know, im just a fundamentally broken person right now, and at the moment my biggest priority is to quote unquote fix myself.",0
im just a fucked up kid at this point.,0
i dont know how to explain it.,0
thanks for reaching out though.,0
"before i made this post i just felt completely useless, unimportant.",0
"i just wanted to have a discussion with someone about, well, stuff.",0
"but the outpouring of support was incredible, and actually helped way more than anything ive done so far.",0
"i guess i dont really know what i need, but the fact that people whove never even met me are willing to be there to provide whatever they can has really meant a lot.",0
"sorry i cant really get my thoughts together, and thanks for your reply.",0
medication to me seems like a craps shoot.,0
"im currently on prozac, but ive only been on it for a short period of time, and so far its done nothing for me.",0
"ive also tried remiron, which made me hypersomnia for untold hours a day, and clomipramine, which worked really well right up until it stopped.",0
ive seen so many doctors that its just become a situation of too many chefs spoiling the stew.,0
"the weird thing about being suicidal, to me, is that i think that urge would be there even if things were going well for me, even if i was still in school.",0
"i spend most of my days finding reasons to feel like crap, and i cant really stop it.",0
it just feels like my life is me running up a down escalator.,0
"i cant make it to the top, and whenever i get exhaustion and take a breather, i just go right back down to the bottom.",0
i cant even blame it on circumstances.,0
i just feel like a broken person.,0
the way things work is just stupid.,0
this post has helped me more than all my friends combined.,0
"its good to have people who can relate, that you can talk to.",0
"its a damn good feeling to be there for someone, and have someone be there for you.",0
"ive got a new therapist, and im going to start something called dbt next week, which im pretty excited about.",0
apparently its a bit like buddhism.,0
"we had our heat wave last week, and things have gotten pretty ok here now.",0
"during my depression, it was easy to be sad and use the sadness as an excuse to justify my actions.",0
"although i was in pain, in a way, it was comfortable.",0
i try to keep myself physically busy to hinder the temptation of being sad and cynical.,0
failing to kill myself help me abandon all my responsibilities and try a care free life for once.,0
"it was great, but eventually, i realized a person cannot live without tasks or work.",0
no desire or passion towards anything.,0
"while im walking through the abyss, others tell me how im good and say that they are jealous of my skills.",0
"i only know those things because, ever since i was a child, i looked for my passion.",0
"interesting, but never fascinating.",0
i live day to day with simple pleasure such as food and naps.,0
"who knows, maybe i will find something to do later.",0
i feel exactly the same right now.,0
i wish i didnt exist in the first place so i dont have to anxiety about killing myself.,0
it feels good to know im not the only one.,0
"there was one thing i ever had a passion for, but my parents were not supportive, rather harsh.",0
i worked at a factory and it was more depressed mood than college.,0
"although i have nothing go on with, one thing is true:",0
i myself suffer from mental depression and major clinical anxiety mental depression attacks.,0
the mental depression sucks but the anxiety mental depression is worse.,0
"when mental depression bouts hit me, i only either get exhaustion and unmotivated or, a few times a year, suicidal.",0
but when the anxiety mental depression attacks i get are common in my weekly life?,0
"my therapist calls it my  as in  ill start with some problem im having, and in a split second, my mind will follow that  to some highly illogical conclusion.",0
for instance i can be having a problem with my friend.,0
"so as you can see, these sorts of ordinary problems a person might experience, my mind warps it into:",0
my friend and i had a fight - im going to die homeless in a gutter somewhere.,0
"my father was an abusive drunk/drug user who would always beat my mother, my two siblings, and myself.",0
"the first time i tried to kill myself, i was 10 years old.",0
"i tried to hang myself on the school monkey bars because, on top of the other stuff, i was always bullied at school for my weight.",0
"i had a plan with a knife too, and when push came to shove on my pre-meditated time and day, i didnt have the courage or guts or willpower or whatever to do myself in.",0
ill give a very brief pre-amble of my life.,0
"ive been depressed mood since the age of ten, and thought about suicide since 13/14.",0
"i got a girlfriend senior year of hs, went to university, and dropped out during my 2nd semester.",0
"said gf ventricular dysfunction, left me a week prior to our one year and she shacked up with a friend i introduced her to.",0
"i spiralled hard, tried to take my life, and was in the psyche ward for two weeks.",0
"struggled with mental depression for about two years after that, suicidal included, but things are stable now.",0
"i too feel a split in my mind, between rational, clear thought, and the depraved, senseless destruction that is my disorder.",0
"it feels very afraid of the other majority, and it wants desperately to make it all go away, but isnt always sure it can take the steps necessary to do so.",0
ive routinely lied and manipulated the truth in front of my doctors.,0
"nobody knows the full picture of what ive gone through - just bits and select pieces, as i feel they need to know.",0
ive struggled with alcoholism and heavy tobacco use.,0
ive struggled with adrenaline drug craving and all kinds of destructive behaviour.,0
theres so much stuff that i just cant and wont talk about.,0
whats difficult is when there is literally nothing i can do to control what i feel and what i think.,0
its not because im new to it or uneducated or poorly equipped to cope.,0
"its because things are really, truly fucked up.",0
"i hope i dont sound ungrateful, because im not.",0
drinking replaced other substance abuse issues in my life - mostly prescription abuse - and it already feels like a fallback.,0
its what i do when im trying _not_ to do something worse.,0
i kinda feel like youve missed the point.,0
"maybe thats my fault for being a poor communicator, i dunno.",0
"in my world, it makes more sense to flirt with a little incision or two than to flirt with putting a loaded gun in my mouth.",0
its already a replacement for a terrible habit.,0
i know how to live with my own addled brain.,0
ive certainly had enough practice.,0
"whats difficult isnt managing the intrusive thoughts, or handling the occasional minor mood swing, or any of that.",0
"i just feel like i wasnt clear about the reality of my situation, probably because ive spent a lot of time here writing about my situation and sort of assume people will do some background research on me.",0
"thats probably a dumb assumption, though :",0
whats with these quacks who think that its possible to just magically  of yourself and make the disorder go away?,0
"its not under our control, thats what makes it a disease.",0
"if i could just  and stop feeling depressed mood or manic, dont you think i would?",0
"do you really believe that i _want_ to be this way, and therefore dont take steps to change?",0
"i find that, unlike most cases, my hypersomnia is controlled by my episodes and not vice versa.",0
"i can and will hypersomnia fine most of the time, but as soon as a cycle starts, there is nothing at all i can do  that will even my sleeping back out until everything dies down.",0
"as is normal, i hypersomnia a lot more when depressed mood and often go days without any hypersomnia when psychiatric symptom.",0
-ive been diagnosed for almost 5 years and still dont know what to think about it or how to deal with it.,0
"you get better at it, but i dont really think it ever gets easier.",0
im afraid of the consequences.,0
it might mean mood he wants to adjust my medication again  or even have me committed.,0
"i guess its totally irrational, but it just seems like if i can control what he knows itll help control the course of my treatment.",0
"maybe it just boils down to a control issue, i dont know.",0
"oh, i know i didnt magically wish bipolar disorder disorder onto myself.",0
"just kind of ironic that i remember thinking that as a kid, and then wham, i grow up and here i am.",0
"i get what youre saying about treatment helping, and i appreciate the sentiment.",0
but what scares me is that even at my absolute best this kind of stuff haunts me.,0
"i cant increase my dosage of antidepressants without triggering manic episodes, and i have bad side effects from all the mood stabilizers and antipsychotics ive been on  so im kind of stuck.",0
"my current cocktail does a great job of keeping me level and stable, but the thoughts never go away.",0
"definitely going to bring this up with my doctor now that i realize it consciously, though, and see what he thinks.",0
i get that a lot during my mental depression/mixed episodes.,0
"its come down to me getting very unpleasant with my friends at times, which makes it even more difficult for them to _want_ to be around when stuff gets bad.",0
sort of a self-reinforcing issue.,0
"but i can remember, even at a young age, deliberately making decisions that would make me depressed mood - like refusing to go to a friends party, or whatnot.",0
"seems like this streak has been with me for as long as i can recall, so im not sure i can solely blame it on my bad experiences growing up.",0
"im in a remarkably similar situation - 24, bipolar disorder, wrestling with mania leukemia, myelocytic, acute and mixed states at the moment.",0
"less severe episodes are actually not uncommon either; not every single experience is either whacked-out mania leukemia, myelocytic, acute or deep depression.",0
"probably 80% of my cycles  are just abnormally drug abuse or low moods  and they occur fairly often, probably every couple of months or so.",0
really extreme episodes are maybe once or twice a year.,0
ive given up on romantic relationships in general.,0
"when im depressed mood, any probing at all, no matter how well-intentioned, will make me extremely anger and liable to do something very, very horrible.",0
"sometimes i quit with some vague excuse, and other times i just.",0
"ive come close to doing the chart and stickers thing many times, because i too will occasionally just forget, or make up excuses, or whatever else.",0
"even a single missed dose means an unavoidable episode for me, so i always know when it happens - but not always immediately, which is annoying.",0
"i just got back on my own medication after a two month lapse, and its hardly the first time in the past several years.",0
whiskey helps everything ;-i dont like the word  it implies a historical connection i never have had.,0
i dealt with a lot of anger when i was first diagnosed.,0
it just seemed so _unfair_ that i would get smacked with this while other people got by just fine.,0
"even now, i still have some lingering bitterness that surfaces in the rougher times; ill often  mock people for their silly, petty, carefree lives who whine about first world problems and other nonsensical shit like that.",0
i think what gets me the most is people who think they can understand without having gone through something like this firsthand; i have a thinly veiled but hatefully deep well of scorn and spite for those people.,0
"the broad strokes will suffice, thank you very much, and ill tell you the symptoms so we can keep the prescriptions flowing, but frankly ive only ever had one doctor i respected enough to be honest with about much.",0
one of my personal warning signs of a _bad_ doctor is someone who plays the pigeonhole game:,0
"oh, you have x, y, and z combination of symptoms, well throw a, b, and c drugs at it and never deviate.",0
i literally felt like i had the mental capacity of a child while i was on it.,0
"i couldnt think straight, couldnt speak clearly, and moved slowly and awkwardly.",0
my doctor at that time insisted that i was fine and that i was just experiencing  after years of hypomania and mixed episodes.,0
"eventually, after doing my own research on the medication, it became pretty obvious that he was full of shit and i fired him.",0
"ive done various permutations of lexapro, wellbutrin, abilify, and seroquel  and they work pretty well.",0
ive made it this far out of pure rotten stubbornness.,0
"someday or later, this goddamn disease might kill me.",0
most of the time i secretly suspect that when i die itll be self-inflicted.,0
"his philosophy was to err on the side of making me feel better, and then tone things down and/or increase the controls from the other medications as necessary.",0
"for the last couple of years ive been small doses of lexapro and wellbutrin daily, with varying doses of abilify to respond to excessively manic mood changes, and occasional seroquel as a sort of  to shut things down if they ever get out of control.",0
"it works pretty darn well, but i fired three different doctors before finding one who was even willing to propose such a cocktail, let alone stick with me long enough to find a mixture that worked.",0
"it may get me eventually, and maybe thats inevitable.",0
its frustrating because most of the medication out there seems targeted at long-term maintenance and finding something that can even out the hour-by-hour roller-coaster is tough.,0
"also a possibility; ive had some self-image issues in the past  and havent totally worked through all of that, so it could well be a factor.",0
got as far as filling out a few application forms and decided i couldnt lie about my psych profile.,0
even though i survived my attempt it still pains my dad to look at me sometimes.,0
he feels like he failed as a father for letting me get to that point.,0
so i have instead devoted my time to making it up to everyone and proving that it was never their fault and that i care for them.,0
"every time i look at my scar i renew my promise to be better, for my friends and family.",0
my dad was a police officer for 14 years.,0
he witnessed two suicides of guys he met about 2 minutes before they pulled the trigger.,0
my friends always call my dad the most badass person they ever met and they dont know that 11 years later he still wakes up almost every night because he sees them occur in his dreams over and over again.,0
sitting there just hating myself and wondering why because i didnt even have a reason.,0
then getting so pissed that i didnt and becoming more depressed mood.,0
but i have never faced a delimna of not being satisfied with my gender i can say there are parts of me that i can never be happy with or ever want.,0
it made me feel like an animal or an object rather than a human.,0
"every night i go to bed hoping and wishing so much that i just wont wake up in the morning, brain aneurism or something, and every time i wake up it hurts that i have to go through another day.",0
suicide is a ache in the ass and just not existing would be nice.,0
ive been seriously thinking about making a noose myself for a few days now.,0
ive tried the knife to the heart one.,0
"if youre going to kill yourself let me know, then maybe we die at the same time and it wont be as alone.",0
"funny, i made a similar post recently in r/suicidewatch about envying those with cancer.",0
there are other people just as pathetic and worthless as us.,0
i guess we have the same line of thought.,0
its probably not just you and me though.,0
its been a year for me since i survived my suicide attempt and im still not there.,0
"there are a few days every once in a while were i appreciate it but mostly i feel the same as you, like being apathetic and carefree.",0
"ive dealt with mental depression for maybe 13 years now, and its never pretty.",0
"tried to run away, kill myself, get lost in substance abuse, stop caring and just do whatever i wanted.",0
"nothing seemed to help for long, and even after starting the journey of finding the right antidepressants, i had a few psychological breakdowns.",0
"then, after a particularly bad stay in the hospital, i stopped making plans for fixing anything.",0
ive attempted suicide before-- and it wasnt unsuccessful by much.,0
"i deal with depression, and have been dealing with it for many years now.",0
"it has been more than a little while since ive been in drug abuse school, but id like to think i still remember those times enough to be helpful.",0
"even though i try to kill myself on occasion, its not worth it.",0
im guilty of thinking that myself most days.,0
i always had robotics as my comforting net in drug abuse school but when i was there my boyfriend of the time  always got anger at me for being so interested in a  i get so self conscious there now from it especially since one person who abused me i met through robotics.,0
my mom is really sick and i dont want to ask for money for a laptop because i know she needs it.,0
"not only that, her minivan could die at any time.",0
i know its a depressed mood time of year and all and i cant offer much advice seeing ive been suicidal and almost acting on it for at least 2 weeks but i will be here to listen and talk too.,0
i got selfish and wanted time with him when he wanted alone time.,0
i feel really bad now that he is grumpy.,0
i recently lost my close friend i think i know how you might feel right now.,0
chiefly among them is that on a day like today i know i would be temped to use it on myself.,0
i though going to hypersomnia and not waking up would be the answer.,0
i figured it would be the most passive way to do what i am otherwise not brave enough to do.,0
problem is that i have a pretty nice car and i fear that all the airbags and crumple zones would leave me with some mild damage and a totaled car or even worse paralyzed.,0
that is a fate i imagine to be worse than my current life.,0
truth be told im fairly smart and it is surprisingly hard to kill yourself or anyone else for that matter without a certain degree of violence to which i am not inclined.,0
i feel like my entire life is unrequited.,0
i feel like my efforts are never good enough to meet the goals i set forth for myself.,0
professionally im an utter failure and cant stay at a job for even 2 years.,0
im quite adept but ive never been promoted and on a couple of occasions have been fired.,0
im fairly well endowed which couples with an average amount of charm and the internet allows me to always have a companion but i rarely feel like they love me for more than my prowess in bed.,0
ive even considered at times chopping my girthy appendage off but again the violence that requires prevents me from accomplishing what in my mind is a tidy solution.,0
i wouldnt mind being in my body on this earth for 50 more years but i fear that if it is 50 like these these past 30 or so years have been it is just a waste of everyones time.,0
i have so much untapped potential that it seems foolish to waste it by ending my life but then again if there was something worthwhile in there would i really keep circling back to this same conclusion?,0
tried to shoot myself but got too drunk to remember why i was drinking.,0
i went to visit her and we hooked up.,0
but she lives 6 hours away and its very easy for her to cheat.,0
shes a documented sociopath and never feels bad.,0
but weve been best friends for years so we kinda just agreed marriage would work.,0
and no to hotlines or professionals,0
because shes at her guy  house and her phone is  so i cant even ask her about it.,0
i went through a period in my life where i wanted to commit suicide.,0
"and my close friend, who had actually just made an attempt on her life a few weeks prior, said this to me dont let something you arent sure about be the reason you leave your friends and family behind.",0
i was a very unhappy teenager.,0
"tried oding several times, somehow never died.",0
and i didnt appreciate my parents.,0
my biggest thing is i would lose control and act like a fool when i was younger.,0
"alone, depressed, questioning my worth.",0
and ive tried killing myself several time in the past by od.,0
i already pay $50 / session for my psych.,0
"im feeling better this morning but i will drug withdrawal syndrome again so i will be in touch, i really really appreciate this gesture",0
"haha its terrible but now i just crying reflex, abnormal",0
unfortunately ive had a bad experience with telling any kind of friend be it close friend or just you know a friend coworker about what happens i find that it makes them upset and eventually they leave.,0
all it takes is two people to do that and i feel uncomfortable saying anything because i dont want to be a burden on the friend and i dont want them to have to try to fix me in some way.,0
i lost my closest friend in college because of that- she felt that if i went to church more everything would be better.,0
"i appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, it makes a difference.",0
its a new diagnosis so im not quite straightened out yet,0
i always want to yell at them.,0
what did i do to not deserve this!,0
i keeping being stupid and joining dating sites.,0
thats like setting myself up for failure.,0
it sucks because i know deep down it will.,0
right now though that seems like such a long shot,0
that is one of my biggest regrets of college- i wish i would have rushed but i was anxiety i wouldnt get matched with one an everyone would know!,0
im not sure how to feel better anymore.,0
i just want to be loved and it wont happen,0
im sorry for asking that was ignorant of me :,0
sometimes i say the worst things,0
i promise im trying to be positive but i keep getting knocked down.,0
i wanted to just walk out but i need to be level headed and responsible.,0
i keep writing about everything and hope that will somehow help.,0
i like having the support even if its just from strangers.,0
"i was okay when i first ventricular dysfunction, left.",0
that makes everything so much worse.,0
"im 24, no one would ever guess how truly sad i am.",0
the meds arent so bad i kinda wish they did numbness everything but they dont.,0
idk why but the worst part is never being in love.,0
i even joined a co ed 16 in league to make friends but i come up empty.,0
i have a really big heart but no one wants it.,0
i get what you mean mood about not being meant to live this life.,0
i often find myself thinking that i am only here to make other people happy.,0
i make them smile and laugh like im a clown but its so dark on the inside.,0
an i just want someone to see.,0
i think just mental depression.,0
i lost motivation to do anything.,0
i just want things to get better,0
"every time i think enought about it i crying reflex, abnormal and crying reflex, abnormal.",0
i think about it at least once a week sometimes more like this week.,0
it stinks because you cant really tell anyone.,0
i was placed on psychiatric hold in college and it made me want to do it even more.,0
i always want to do that but i work full time and could never afford it on my own.,0
i feel like in damned if i do and damned if i dont.,0
i think more than anything i want help.,0
i wish my future self could come and tell me it will be okay.,0
but i cant even picture my future.,0
i appreciate your concern and your reply.,0
i want to move far away but my mom is sick.,0
"if i ventricular dysfunction, left or died no one would take care of her.",0
but sometimes i wonder if someday things will get better for me?,0
guys use me then leave every time.,0
i went to college out of state so my friends are spread across the country.,0
"i had a friend here since we were 9, but a few months back she told me i was too sensitive to be around.",0
i was recently diagnosed as bipolar disorder.,0
"i try not to be sensitive, but sometimes i cannot help it.",0
i just want things to get better.,0
i just got a big promotion this week.,0
i was getting through fathers day well enough until my sister called my mom.,0
she said its hard to be around me because i smell bad.,0
i spent all day at her house yesterday  cleaning her house and helping babysit her one week old so she could hypersomnia and go to a wedding.,0
i know im overreacting so i understand if this post is just obnoxious.,0
i tried killing myself when i was a sophomore in college because my dad refused to speak with me because i wouldnt play intermural  basketball and i was deep in mental depression as it was.,0
i know what its like to be a mental patient.,0
"i thought maybe, foolishly, my dad would love me after that.",0
it just made him even more angry.,0
dont know there as dumb as it sounds i feel like i dont even deserve help.,0
this is the third time in a row that any relationship i have ended due to the same reasons.,0
i struggle to have emotions lol.,0
i legit do not trust a single person in the world to actually allow them to know who i and what i truly am due to im just social fear of what they really will think.,0
i have really horrible thoughts i feel compared to most people mostly about myself.,0
i try to do things that made me happy before because im a big geek.,0
i love anime i love computers and playing games and going to the gym and nothing really helps.,0
when i play games i just feel like im masking my sadness and when i go to the gym i just feel like im losing more weight because ive all ready lost weight due to this entire issue.,0
and all i do now is just drink energy drinks instead of eating a meal.,0
ive been though six psychiatrist so far and nothing has helped and i refuse to take meds because they just made me into something that i wasnt.,0
i dont understand why or what i did to make it to the point where she refuses to even talk to me or see me in person anymore.,0
whats even worse is that i dont know what to do either if she just needs time to think and actually does decide to come back.,0
like id devote my times and effort to make myself a better person and finally allow someone in but should i even?,0
i know exactly what horribly sick is.,0
due to my lack of knowledge i took over 120 to 150 over the counter ache killers two times and i failed both time.,0
and as sad as it is my room mate is just as depressed mood as i am.,0
lol its like the dynamic duo of fail.,0
i just dont understand how for the past three years we said wed be together for ever and i was fucking dumb enough to believe that.,0
to think id finally found someone who can make me whole and without any pause or hesitation she just ups and leaves.,0
i dont understand how you can look someone in the eyes and say  and then leave without even trying to talk things out even when the other person whats to change / fix things and work on things together.,0
like how i ruin every relationship im ever in.,0
i would sit in the chicken house and just watch them interact with each other.,0
im not going to do anything yet.,0
no i dont find it frightening.,0
"well, i soon discovered that i actually started having real panic attacks attacks whenever i went to school.",0
"im trying to learn korean since im a korean-american but kindergartners can speak, write and understand the language at a higher level than me, and nothing.",0
they always made me feel stupid.,0
hes very open to me about his feelings.,0
"im lonely, too.",0
"pathetic because i cant make myself to do anything, i lie often, i abuse weed and occasionally drink too much.",0
"its not about me losing the right to die, its more of me losing my will.",0
i went through so many shitty therapists that didnt do anything for me and then four years later i found one who changed my life.,0
"i posted in the desperate hope that there is something that i missed, something to make a a decent human, but there appears to be not.",0
6 months i have been this way for years over ten i stopped counting and i know how it feels to be dead inside so dead that lifa and death taste the same to me,0
"ive been like this for four years, with constant suicidal thoughts.",0
"im in a remarkably similar situation - 24, bipolar disorder, wrestling with mania leukemia, myelocytic, acute and mixed states at the moment.",0
"there is, but i dont like being around the people there.",0
"ive dabbled in cbt a bit, but i hate it, mainly because there are right answers to all the questions.",0
just recently i moved from a school where i knew almost everyone and could have easily made friends with anyone i wanted.,0
well we arent best friends anymore.,0
three years later were still in the same town:,0
just because i want to be rich doesnt mean im selfish.,0
i just need someone to talk to,0
i try to not to let it get to me but it does.,0
at this rate my roommates hate me i am to much of a downer im going to wait for my day off when they r both gone and see just how deep i can cut sorry but i am no pillar of strength you waste your time on me,0
couldnt help me so whats the point.,0
"and i am so scared to leave him, because he has an awful family life and i feel like im his only support.",0
my dad didnt care.,0
going to do it - will do it.,0
I just cant be arsed.,0
im so fed up.,0
you dont know how hard it is for me.,0
you cant help me.,0
you should just let me die.,0
"go do something else, im dying anyway.",0
why do you care about me then.,0
"i can, and do, control myself.",0
im not going to die yet.,0
i dont want to die but:,0
i know that i am loved.,0
i try very very hard.,0
"ive tried, and i failed.",0
what led me to postpone my suicide plans for today is the futile and slight hope of somehow getting away and starting over,0
even tho you guys know more about my situation than most of the people that know me for almost my whole life.,0
this is my feelings exactly.,0
"used to have recurring nightmares about my family but theyre going away now, maybe the medication has started working.",0
"ive lived on subsistence so long, it is hard to break away.",0
but its sooo hard sometimes.,0
people i talked with also said that this is life.,0
"when i dont cut, and realize i should, i play guitar.",0
"to me it seemed as though there was no reason to keep living, the people that are supposed to care about you the most dont.",0
