I'm truly sorry to hear about the distress you're experiencing. It's important to remember that feelings of disappointment and despair are temporary and can be addressed. I'm here to help you explore some options.

Firstly, I'd like to emphasize the importance of reaching out to someone who can provide immediate help.

Success is not defined solely by what is popular on social media platforms. There are many ways to measure success, and it's crucial to focus on the things that bring you personal satisfaction and happiness.

I'm also concerned about your mention of a .357 gun. It's crucial not to use this as a coping mechanism. If you feel unsafe with this weapon, please consider removing it from your immediate surroundings or informing someone you trust about its presence.

Lastly, it's understandable to feel unappreciated at times, especially when it comes to family relationships. However, it's important to remember that love is not always expressed in the way we expect. Your daughter may not express her love for you in the way you'd like, but that doesn't mean she doesn't care. If you're feeling disconnected from her, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about your feelings.

I want to start by acknowledging the courage it takes to share your thoughts and feelings with me today. I can sense the depth of your pain and the complexity of your emotions. It's important to remember that you are not alone in this struggle, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

Firstly, I want to address your concerns about the motives of people who remove anonymity on suicide-related forums. It's understandable to feel vulnerable and exposed in such a setting, but it's also important to remember that not everyone has malicious intentions. Some people may be sharing their own experiences in the hope of helping others, or they may be seeking help themselves.

I also understand your frustration with insurance policies that offer payouts after a suicide. It's a difficult and complex issue, and it's understandable that it feels ironic and unfair. However, it's important to remember that these policies are in place to provide financial support to the loved ones left behind, and they are not a reflection of the value of a person's life.

Your newfound passion for photography is a beautiful and powerful reason to continue living. I encourage you to explore this passion further, and to find ways to express yourself through your art. It can be a powerful outlet for your emotions and a source of comfort and solace.

I also want to address your concerns about the suicide rate in the US.

The author is seeking advice on how to suppress thoughts of self-harm that they find comforting, emphasizing that they do not need help making friends or dealing with feelings of isolation. They value their solitude and have a good circle of friends. They are not asking for reassurance about these issues but are instead seeking strategies to dismiss suicidal thoughts.","Dear Author,

I'm really sorry to hear that you're struggling with suicidal thoughts, but I'm glad to see that you have a good support system of friends and value your solitude. It's important to remember that these thoughts are not a reflection of your worth, but rather a sign that you're going through a difficult time.

Here are a few strategies that might help you manage these thoughts:

1. Mindfulness and Distraction: Try to focus on the present moment. This could be as simple as noticing the sights, sounds, and sensations around you. Distracting yourself with a hobby, a book, or a favorite movie can also help.

2. Reach Out: Even though you value your solitude, it's okay to reach out to someone when you're feeling this way. You don't have to burden your friends with your feelings, but a simple message or call might help you feel less alone.

3. Self-Care: Make sure you're taking care of your physical health. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep can all help improve your mood.

4. Professional Help: If your thoughts persist, it might be helpful to speak with a mental health professional. They can provide you with additional strategies and support.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

I understand that you're going through a challenging time, and I want to express my deepest empathy for the struggles you're facing. It's commendable that you've reached out for help, and I'm here to support you.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge your strength in seeking strategies to manage your thoughts of self-harm. It's a brave step towards taking control of your mental health.

One strategy that might help is cognitive restructuring. This involves challenging and changing the negative thoughts that lead to self-harm. You can try to identify these thoughts, question their validity, and replace them with more positive and constructive ones.

Another strategy is distraction. When you feel the urge to engage in self-harm, try to distract yourself with a healthy activity, such as reading a book, going for a walk, or listening to music.

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed at times, and it's important to reach out for help when you need it. If you ever feel that you're in immediate danger, please don't hesitate to contact the Emergency Services on 999. If you're not comfortable calling, you can text SHOUT on 85258.

[Your Role]","Dear Author,

I'm truly sorry to hear about the heavy burden you're carrying. It's clear that you're going through a difficult time, and I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way. You're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to reach out and share your feelings. This is a significant step towards seeking help and finding a way out of the rut you're in. I understand that you're feeling stuck, trapped, and without a clear vision for your future. It's understandable to feel this way when life seems to be moving at a pace that doesn't align with your dreams and aspirations.

I want to encourage you to consider seeking professional help. There are resources available in the UK that can provide support and guidance. The Samaritans (116 123) is a helpline that offers confidential emotional support, day or night. If you're not comfortable calling, you can text SHOUT (85258) instead.

I also want to address the guilt you're feeling about your situation. It's important to remember that it's never too late to make changes, and it's never your fault if things haven't turned out the way you wanted them to. You're not responsible for the expectations others may have of you, and it's okay to redefine your own path and goals.

Regarding your work, I understand that feeling underpaid and undervalued can be demoralizing. However, it's important to remember that every job has its own value, and your work contributes to the world in ways that may not always be immediately apparent. I encourage you to consider seeking advice from a career counselor or mentor who can help you explore new opportunities and find a career that aligns with your passions and goals.

Lastly, I want to address the lies you're telling your parents about passing exams and graduating. I understand that you may feel trapped and powerless, but it's important to remember that honesty is essential in maintaining healthy relationships. Lying to your parents only adds to your burden and can cause them unnecessary pain. I encourage you to find the courage to be honest with",73.98,6.5,70.63,7.8,0.8132829666137695,0.8139692544937134,0.8481427431106567,0.8524810671806335,0.5004193782806396,0.533872663974762,0.992268979549408,0.992495059967041
